  <description>&lt;b&gt;All systems fail. All societies crumble. All worlds end.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the authoritarian Federation, there is a plot to assassinate and replace the President, a man who has downloaded his mind to a succession of new bodies to maintain his grip on power. Meanwhile, on the fringes of a Western Europe that has renounced human governance in favor of ostensibly more efficient, objective, and peaceful AI Prime Ministers, an experimental artificial mind is malfunctioning, threatening to set off a chain of events that may spell the end of the Western world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Federation and the West both start to crumble, Lilia, the brilliant scientist whose invention may be central to bringing down the seemingly immortal President, goes on the run, trying to break out from a near-impenetrable web of Federation surveillance. Her fate is bound up with a worldwide group of others fighting against the global status quo: Palmer, the man Lilia left behind in London, desperate to solve the mystery of her disappearance; Zoya, a veteran activist imprisoned in the taiga, whose book has inspired a revolutionary movement; Nikolai, the President’s personal physician, who has been forced into more and more harrowing decisions as he navigates the Federation’s palace politics; and Nurlan, the hapless parliamentary staffer whose attempt to save his Republic goes terribly awry. And then there is Krotov, head of the Federation’s security services, whose plots, agents, and assassins are everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the success of his debut novel, &lt;i&gt;The Mountain in the Sea&lt;/i&gt;, Ray Nayler launches readers into a thrilling near-future world of geopolitical espionage. A cybernetic novel of political intrigue, &lt;i&gt;Where the Axe is Buried&lt;/i&gt; combines the story of a near-impossible revolutionary operation with a blistering indictment of the many forms of authoritarianism that suffocate human freedom.</description>

  <description>"Book Two of The Prince of Nothing" finds the Holy War continuing its inexorable march southward. But the suspicion begins to dawn that the real threat comes not from the infidel but from within...Steering souls through the subtleties of word and expression, Kellhus strives to extend his dominion over the Men of the Tusk. The sorcerer Achamian and his lover, Esmenet, submit entirely, only to have their faith - and their love - tested in unimaginable ways. Meanwhile, the warrior Cnaiur falls ever deeper into madness. Convinced that Kellhus will betray their pact to murder his father, Cnaiur turns to the agents of the Second Apocalypse and strikes an infernal bargain. The Holy War stands on a knife edge. If all is not to be lost, the great powers of the world will have to choose between their most desperate desires and the end of the world. Between hatred and hope. Between Anasurimbor Kellhus and the second apocalypse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Preble Jefferson can see five seconds into the future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, he lives an ordinary life. But when a confrontation with a cop on a New York City subway goes tragically wrong, those seconds give Preble the chance to dodge a bullet—causing another man to die in his place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Government agencies become aware of Preble’s gift, a manhunt ensues, and their ambitions shift from law enforcement to military R&amp;amp;D. Preble will do whatever it takes to protect his family, but as events spiral out of control, he must weigh the cost of his gift against the loss of his humanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A breathless thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page, The Man Who Saw Seconds explores the nature of time, the brain as a prediction machine, and the tension between the individual and the systems we create. Alexander Boldizar provides an adrenaline-pumping read that will leave you contemplating love, fear and the abyss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Man Who Saw Seconds is an action thriller…that is genuinely thrilling: the pacing is perfect, and the stakes ratchet up in a horrifying, relentless, and seemingly inevitable progression...I hope this can be genre-spanning, and that it gets the attention it deserves from every awards list, science fiction and not." &lt;br /&gt;—Locus Magazine</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The time has come! Book seven in the bestselling Dungeon Crawler Carl series is here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call it Faction Wars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ninth floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine armies, each led by rich and powerful aliens from across the galaxy. Each team has one objective: to capture and hold the castle at the very center of the battlefield. Strategy, alliances, pitched battles, and, of course, betrayal... It all makes for great fun and even greater television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, none of these powerful aliens really die when they’re playing war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this time. This time, winner takes all. Those who fall, stay in the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the AI continues its rapid decline, Carl and company take advantage of the chaos. For the first time ever, the crawlers are fighting back. They are now one of the nine teams. And this season, there’s a tenth army on the playing field. The NPCs, who are normally used as nothing but cannon fodder, have become fully self-aware and formed a team of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Donut and Katia, the stakes are even higher. Only one of them will be allowed to leave this level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they all want to survive, they’re going to need a little help from a veteran or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it.&lt;br /&gt;This is what they’ve been fighting toward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is war.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This inevitable ruin.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A pantheon of forgotten gods. An old grudge between a talk show host, an heiress, and the man they shattered along the way. A rapidly deteriorating AI system. An inconvenient tiara upon the head of a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is bedlam on the eighth floor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As management reels from the unexpected conclusion of the seventh level, the surviving crawlers stumble onto the eighth and find themselves scattered. It’s a map based on Earth’s final days before the collapse, where ethereal, intangible ghosts of humanity go about their lives, oblivious of the impending doom. Living amongst these ghosts are monsters based in Earth lore. “Legendary” creatures tied to the geographical location they inhabit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each team of crawlers is given a task: find and capture six of these beasts. The captured monsters will be turned into cards. Cards that can be summoned into battle again and again. The stronger, the deadlier, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the floor, the bad guys will also have decks, and they will have some of the most powerful cards available. So it’s crucial to assemble the toughest squad possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, like always, there is a catch. There’s always a catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Carl and Donut know all too well, just because someone is captured, it doesn’t mean they have been tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her name is Shi Maria. She’s easily the most powerful monster in their area. If they want to survive, they must capture her. But she is no ordinary beast. She’s intelligent. She was once married to a god, a god who is now missing. Her special attack is known to drive one insane. They call her the Bedlam Bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Beware, beware. Beware the Eye of the Bedlam Bride”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Attention. Attention. The gates are down. The hunters are loose. Run, Run, Run.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lush jungle teeming with danger. Savage dinosaurs seeking blood. A fallen princess intent on vengeance. A mysterious, end-of-floor celebration for the top crawlers, dubbed “The Butcher’s Masquerade.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sixth floor. The Hunting Grounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the remaining crawlers battle for their lives, a new, terrible threat looms. Outside tourists are finally allowed to enter the game, and they are here and ready to hunt. Among them is Vrah, a famed and veteran hunter, intent on collecting the biggest trophy of her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their prey is far from harmless, and this season they are fighting back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dungeon Crawler Carl and Princess Donut return in book five of the acclaimed litrpg series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New Achievement! Total, Utter Failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You failed a quest less than five minutes after you received it. Now that’s talent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A floating fortress occupied by warrior gnomes. A castle made of sand. A derelict submarine guarded by malfunctioning machines. A haunted crypt surrounded by lethal traps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be easy. One bubble. Four castles. Fifteen days. Capture each one, and the stairwell is unlocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the thing. It's never easy. Carl and his team can't go it alone. Not this time. They must rely on the help of the low-level, I-can't-believe-these-idiots-are-still-alive crawlers trapped in the bubble with them. But can they be trusted? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome, Crawler. Welcome to the fifth floor of the dungeon.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the Gun Show! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top ten list is populated. The sponsorship program is open. The difficulty is ramping up. The first three floors were nothing compared to what Carl and Donut now face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iron Tangle. An impossibly-complicated subway system built out of the world's subterranean railway systems, all combined and then tied together into a knot. Up is down. Down is up. Close is far. The cars are filled with monsters, the railway stations are less than safe, and the exit is always just a few stops away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is hope. For the first time, the crawlers are all working together. The loot is better than ever. And the secret to unraveling it all may be hidden in the pages of a seemingly-useless book. Welcome, crawlers. Welcome to the fourth floor of the dungeon.</description>

  <description>"The training levels have concluded. Now the games may truly begin."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ratings and views are off the chart. The fans just can't get enough. The dungeon gets more dangerous each day. But in a grinder designed to chew up and spit out crawlers by the millions, Carl and Princess Donut need to work harder than ever just to survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call it the Over City. A sprawling, once-thriving metropolis devastated by a mysterious calamity. But these streets are far from abandoned. An undead circus trawls the ruins. Murdered prostitutes rain from the sky. An ancient spell is finally ready to reveal its dark purpose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl still has no pants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call it Dungeon Crawler World. For Carl and Donut, it's anything but a game.</description>

  <description>Tara Selter, the heroine of On the Calculation of Volume, has involuntarily stepped off the train of time: in her world, November eighteenth repeats itself endlessly. We meet Tara on her 122nd November 18th: she no longer experiences the changes of days, weeks, months, or seasons. She finds herself in a lonely new reality without being able to explain why: how is it that she wakes every morning into the same day, knowing to the exact second when the blackbird will burst into song and when the rain will begin? Will she ever be able to share her new life with her beloved and now chronically befuddled husband? And on top of her profound isolation and confusion, Tara takes in with pain how slight a difference she makes in the world. (As she puts it: “That’s how little the activities of one person matter on the eighteenth of November.”)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balle is hypnotic and masterful in her remixing of the endless recursive day, creating curious little folds of time and foreshadowings: her flashbacks light up inside the text like old flash bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first volume’s gravitational pull―a force inverse to its constriction―has the effect of a strong tranquilizer, but a drug under which your powers of observation only grow sharper and more acute. Give in to the book's logic (its minute movements, its thrilling shifts, its slant wit, its slowing of time) and its spell is utterly intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solvej Balle’s seven-volume novel wrings enthralling and magical new dimensions from time and its hapless, mortal subjects. As one Danish reviewer beautifully put it, Balle’s fiction consists of writing that listens. “Reading her is like being caressed by language itself.”</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A blazingly original and stylish debut novel about a young man whose reality unravels when he suspects his mysterious employers have inadvertently discovered time travel—and are using it to cover up a string of violent crimes...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four days before Christmas, 8-year-old Bo loses his mother in a tragic accident, 28-year-old Brandon loses his job after a hostile takeover of his big-media employer, and 48-year-old Blue, a key witness in a criminal trial against an infamous now-defunct tech startup, struggles to reconnect with his family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So begins Jinwoo Chong’s dazzling, time-bending debut that blends elements of neo-noir and speculative fiction as the lives of Bo, Brandon, and Blue begin to intersect, uncovering a vast network of secrets and an experimental technology that threatens to upend life itself. Intertwined with them is the saga of an iconic ’80s detective show, &lt;i&gt;Raider,&lt;/i&gt; whose star actor has imploded spectacularly after revelations of long-term, concealed abuse.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flux&lt;/i&gt; is a haunting and sometimes shocking exploration of the cyclical nature of grief, of moving past trauma, and of the pervasive nature of whiteness within the development of Asian identity in America.</description>

  <description>The first book in R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing series creates a world from whole cloth-its language and classes of people, its cities, religions, mysteries, taboos, and rituals. It's a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both two thousand years past and two thousand years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveler, Anasûrimbor Kellhus - part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence - from lands long thought dead. &lt;i&gt;The Darkness That Comes Before&lt;/i&gt; is a history of this great holy war, and like all histories, the survivors write its conclusion.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the World Fantasy Award, and the Alberta Literary Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist for the Locus, Aurora, British Fantasy, Ignyte, and British Science Fiction Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here there be gods and monsters - forged from flesh and stone and vengeance - emerging from the icy abyss of deep space, ascending from dark oceans, and prowling strange cities to enter worlds of chaos and wonder, where scientific rigor and human endeavour is tested to the limits. These are cosmic realms and watery domains where old offerings no longer appease the ancient Gods or the new and hungry idols. Deities and beasts. Life and death. Love and hate. Science and magic. And smiling monsters in human skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Premee Mohamed's debut collection of contemporary cosmic horror and dark fantasy heralds the arrival of a new and vibrant voice on the cutting edge of modern speculative fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54659324-dungeon-crawler-carl" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;B08BKGYQXW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The apocalypse will be televised!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man. His ex-girlfriend's cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth—from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds—collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buildings and all the people inside have all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your followers, your views. Your clout. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that "it" factor, you may just find yourself with a following. That's the only way to truly survive in this game—with the help of the loot boxes dropped upon you by the generous benefactors watching from across the galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call it &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Crawler World&lt;/em&gt;. But for Carl, it's anything but a game.</description>

  <description>California has always been our Shangri-la–the promised land of countless pilgrims in search of the American Dream. Now the Golden State’s premier historian, Kevin Starr, distills the entire sweep of California’s history into one splendid volume. From the age of exploration to the age of Arnold, this is the story of a place at once quintessentially American and utterly unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguing that America’s most populous state has always been blessed with both spectacular natural beauty and astonishing human diversity, Starr unfolds a rapid-fire epic of discovery, innovation, catastrophe, and triumph. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For generations, California’s native peoples basked in the abundance of a climate and topography eminently suited to human habitation. By the time the Spanish arrived in the early sixteenth century, there were scores of autonomous tribes were thriving in the region. Though conquest was rapid, nearly two centuries passed before Spain exerted control over upper California through the chain of missions that stand to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The discovery of gold in January 1848 changed everything. With population increasing exponentially as get-rich-quick dreamers converged from all over the world, California reinvented itself overnight. Starr deftly traces the successive waves of innovation and calamity that have broken over the state since then–the incredible wealth of the Big Four railroad tycoons and the devastating San Francisco earthquake of 1906; the emergence of Hollywood as the world’s entertainment capital and of Silicon Valley as the center of high-tech research and development; the heroic irrigation and transportation projects that have altered the face of the region; the role of labor, both organized and migrant, in key industries from agriculture to aerospace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Starr has devoted his career to the history of his beloved state, but he has never lost his sense of wonder over California’s sheer abundance and peerless variety. This one-volume distillation of a lifetime’s work gathers together everything that is most important, most fascinating, and most revealing about our greatest state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Welcome to Alkhalend, Jewel of the Waters, capital of Usmai, greatest of the Successor States, inheritor to the necromantic dominion that was the Moeribandi Empire and tomorrow's frontline in the Palleseen's relentless march to bring Perfection and Correctness to an imperfect world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loret is fresh off the boat, and just in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Cohort-Invigilator of Correct Appreciation, Outreach department, she's here as aide to the Palleseen Resident, Sage-Invigilator Angilly. And Sage-Invigilator Angilly - Gil to her friends - needs a second in the spectacularly illegal, culturally offensive and diplomatically inadvisable duel she must fight at midnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outreach, that part of the Pal machine that has to work within the imperfection of the rest of the world, has a lot of room for the illegal, the unconventional, the unorthodox. But just how much unorthodoxy can Gil and Loret get away with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a succession crisis looms, as a long-forgotten feat of necromantic engineering nears fruition, as pirate kings, lizard armies and demons gather, as old gods wane and new gods wax, sooner or later Gil and Loret will have to settle their ledger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as well they are both very, very good with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE TYRANT PHILOSOPHERS SERIES&lt;br /&gt;'Endlessly creative . . . so much invention peeking around every corner - Patrick Ness&lt;br /&gt;'Dense, dark, ingenious, ironic, complex, often funny, and always smart' Locus&lt;br /&gt;'A master at the height of his powers. This is epic symphonic fantasy, weaving a breakneck plot through a sumptuously dangerous world' Ian Green</description>

  <description>City-by-city, kingdom-by-kingdom, the Palleseen have sworn to bring Perfection and Correctness to an imperfect world. As their legions scour the world of superstition with the bright flame of reason, so they deliver a mountain of ragged, holed and scorched flesh to the field hospital tents just behind the frontline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is where Yasnic, one-time priest, healer and rebel, finds himself. Reprieved from the gallows and sent to war clutching a box of orphan Gods, he has been sequestered to a particularity unorthodox medical unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Led by 'the Butcher', an ogre of a man who's a dab hand with a bone-saw and an alchemical tincture, the unit's motley crew of conscripts, healers and orderlies are no strangers to the horrors of war. Their's is an unspeakable elbow-deep in gore they have a first-hand view of the suffering caused by flesh-rending monsters, arcane magical weaponry and embittered enemy soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entrusted – for now – with saving lives deemed otherwise un-saveable, the field hospital's crew face a precarious existence. Their work with unapproved magic, necromancy, demonology and Yansic's thoroughly illicit Gods could lead to the unit being disbanded, arrested or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beset by enemies within and without, the last thing anyone needs is a miracle…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews for City of Last Chances :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Paints a vivid detailed backdrop' SF X&lt;br /&gt;'Brilliant chaos ensues' Daily Mail&lt;br /&gt;'Some of Tchaikovsky's best prose' SF Crowsnest&lt;br /&gt;'An intriguing tangle… ingenious' Locus&lt;br /&gt;'Endlessly creative' Patrick Ness&lt;br /&gt;'Rich, inventive worldbuilding' Publishers Weekly&lt;br /&gt;'Ilmar is vividly alive' David Towsey&lt;br /&gt;'A master at the height of his powers' Ian Green&lt;br /&gt;'An ambitious epic fantasy read' Grimdark Magazine</description>

  <description>Arthur C. Clarke winner and Sunday Times bestseller Adrian Tchaikovsky's triumphant return to fantasy with a darkly inventive portrait of a city under occupation and on the verge of revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has always been a darkness to Ilmar, but never more so than now. The city chafes under the heavy hand of the Palleseen occupation, the choke-hold of its criminal underworld, the boot of its factory owners, the weight of its wretched poor and the burden of its ancient curse.&lt;br /&gt;What will be the spark that lights the conflagration?&lt;br /&gt;Despite the city's refugees, wanderers, murderers, madmen, fanatics and thieves, the catalyst, as always, will be the Anchorwood – that dark grove of trees, that primeval remnant, that portal, when the moon is full, to strange and distant shores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ilmar, some say, is the worst place in the world and the gateway to a thousand worse places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ilmar, &lt;br /&gt;City of Long Shadows.&lt;br /&gt;City of Bad Decisions.&lt;br /&gt;City of Last Chances.</description>

  <description>There's a natural tendency in investing to focus on the question of what to buy or sell. Nearly 100% of the financial press is dedicated to this question, so it's reasonable to suppose that it's the most important thing we should be thinking about. Investing Sizing will convince you that it's not. Haghani and White explain that the most important decisions to make accurately relate instead to questions of investment sizing--how much risk to take, and how to spread it out. They leave you with a simple framework for making risk and sizing decisions consistently and rationally. Of course, you do need to decide what you want to invest in, and for many investors today the potential investment universe is huge: index funds, active funds, individual stocks and bonds, real estate, hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, the list goes on and on. There are plenty of books out there to help you evaluate each of these types of investments, so they won't be saying much about it. Instead, they will help you translate your evaluation of individual investments into an evaluation of how much risk to take, on each investment and in total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do we think sizing is so important? Consider this: if you pick bad investments but you did a good job sizing them, you should expect to lose money but your losses won't be ruinous. You'll be able to regroup and invest another day. However, if you correctly pick great investments but own way too much of them, you can easily go broke from normal ups and downs while waiting for things to pan out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haghani and White know from experience. Their personal experience backs up the proposition that the sizing decision, often an afterthought in the investment process, is actually the most critical part. Both of them havevvexperienced first-hand the impact of getting the sizing decision wrong, losing the majority of ourvpersonal wealth in the process. Victor was a founding partner at the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), and in 1998 at age 36 he took a nine figure hit when LTCM was undone by that decade's financial crisis. The financial loss was compounded by the psychological blow of the business' failure and its impact on the 153 employees who worked for Victor and his partners, as well as the impact on the reputations of all involved. A decade later James at 28 lost a smaller sum but a material fraction of his wealth, through his investments in the hedge fund where he worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both cases, we could argue that we had selected solid investments with an attractive risk/reward profile, and which were highly likely to pay off in the long run. The trades that took LTCM down in 1998 were money-makers over the ensuing years, and the hedge fund which employed James also bounced back to generate strong returns following its precarious swoon in 2008. Unfortunately, the short run must always come before the long run, and it nearly wiped both of them out. Good investments plus bad sizing can result in catastrophic losses.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this spellbinding debut novel, two estranged half-sisters tasked with guarding their family's library of magical books must work together to unravel a deadly secret at the heart of their collection--a tale of familial loyalty and betrayal, and the pursuit of magic and power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For generations, the Kalotay family has guarded a collection of ancient and rare books. Books that let a person walk through walls or manipulate the elements--books of magic that half-sisters Joanna and Esther have been raised to revere and protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All magic comes with a price, though, and for years the sisters have been separated. Esther has fled to a remote base in Antarctica to escape the fate that killed her own mother, and Joanna's isolated herself in their family home in Vermont, devoting her life to the study of these cherished volumes. But after their father dies suddenly while reading a book Joanna has never seen before, the sisters must reunite to preserve their family legacy. In the process, they'll uncover a world of magic far bigger and more dangerous than they ever imagined, and all the secrets their parents kept hidden; secrets that span centuries, continents, and even other libraries . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the great tradition of &lt;em&gt;Ninth House, The Magicians, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Practical Magic, &lt;/em&gt;this is a suspenseful and richly atmospheric novel that draws readers into a vast world filled with mystery and magic, romance, and intrigue--and marks the debut of an extraordinary new voice in speculative fiction.</description>

  <description>"..&lt;b&gt;.evokes the essential contradictions in Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics&lt;/b&gt;..." -- Marc Donner, &lt;b&gt;IEEE Security &amp;amp; Privacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In the best possible future, there will be no war, no famine, no crime, no sickness, no oppression, no fear, no limits, no shame...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and nothing to do.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a time not far from our own, Lawrence sets out to build an artificial intelligence that can pass as human -- and finds himself instead with one that can pass as a god. Taking the Three Laws of Robotics literally, Prime Intellect makes every human immortal and provides instantly for every stated human desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline, Queen of the Death Jockeys, finds no meaning in this life of purposeless ease, and forgets her emptiness only in moments of violent and profane exhibitionism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At turns shocking and humorous, Prime Intellect looks unflinchingly at the extremes of human behavior that might emerge when all limits are removed. The international internet sensation, first released in 2003, continues to spark debate about one possible human future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A standalone darkly humorous thriller set in modern America's age of anxiety, by &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Jason Pargin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside Los Angeles, a driver pulls up to find a young woman sitting on a large black box. She offers him $200,000 cash to transport her and that box across the country, to Washington, DC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He cannot look inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;He cannot ask questions.&lt;br /&gt;He cannot tell anyone.&lt;br /&gt;They must leave immediately.&lt;br /&gt;He must leave all trackable devices behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As these eccentric misfits hit the road, rumors spread on social media that the box is part of a carefully orchestrated terror attack intended to plunge the USA into civil war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth promises to be even stranger, and may change how you see the world.</description>

  <description>A gifted young knight named Collum arrives at Camelot to compete for a spot on the Round Table, only to find he’s too late. The king died two weeks ago at the Battle of Camlann, leaving no heir, and only a handful of the knights of the Round Table survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren’t the heroes of legend, like Lancelot or Gawain. They’re the oddballs of the Round Tables, from the edges of the stories, like Sir Palomides, the Saracen Knight and Sir Dagonet, Arthur’s fool, who was knighted as a joke. They’re joined by Nimue, who was Merlin’s apprentice until she turned on him and buried him under a hill. Together this ragtag fellowship will set out to rebuild Camelot in a world that has lost its balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Arthur’s death has revealed Britain’s fault lines. God has abandoned it, and the fairies and monsters and old gods are returning, led by Arthur’s half-sister Morgan le Fay. Kingdoms are turning on each other, warlords are laying siege to Camelot, and rival factions are forming around the disgraced Lancelot and the fallen Queen Guinevere. It is up to Collum and his companions to reclaim Excalibur, solve the mysteries of this ruined world and make it whole again. But before they can restore Camelot they’ll have to learn the truth of why the lonely, brilliant King Arthur fell and lay to rest the ghosts of his troubled family and of Britain’s dark past.</description>

  <description>Dr Rick Tower is a mild-mannered English professor easing into middle-age at a medium-sized New England college. A genial blur, he thinks. Even his vices are unremarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it wasn’t always like this. Not until they changed his name, altered his looks and told ‘pretend you were never different’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, decades earlier after a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; bad day at high school, he was committed to a secret government facility with three other kids, Cat, Jack and Stephanie, each special in their own way. Tested, tutored and trained, this extraordinary quartet were then told to save the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the best thing that ever happened to them. Until it became the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, twenty years after the tragedy that forced him into academic non-entity, a mysterious disappearance means Tower must reunite with his former comrades. Each returns with their own agenda. And while great power might come with great responsibility, there’s little of that on display from any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining compelling storytelling and fierce imagination with a rich cast of characters, &lt;i&gt;Fight Me&lt;/i&gt; is a page-turning and distinctive thriller, a unique tale of good and evil, and a memorable portrait of man trying to do the right thing at any cost. Against impossible odds . . .</description>

  <description>How humanity came to the planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end. The Carryx – part empire, part hive – have waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy.  Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team.  Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to learning to understand – and manipulate – the Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination.  He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins.</description>

  <description>Return to the Universe of the ARCANA IMPERII with a collection of novellas from Miles Cameron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the events of ARTIFACT SPACE, the galaxy continues to change and expand. Frontiers are challenged and what was once a safe space becomes contested, hostile, and unpredictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From normal people caught up in the unstoppable machinations of politics and war, to spies faced with making the ultimate sacrifice for their nations, these stories follow the DHC as it faces a challenge to everything it holds dear - human rights, fairness and equality. When a rogue system questions their values and power, how can they stay true to their beliefs and protect their citizens?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what are these rumours about new aliens lurking beyond the edges of known space?</description>

  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second book in a glorious new fantasy trilogy by the next major force in commercial epic fantasy. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of the devastating attack on Ilin Illan, an amnesty has been declared for all Augurs - finally allowing them to emerge from hiding and openly oppose the dark forces massing against Andarra. However as Davian and his new allies hurry north toward the ever-weakening Boundary, fresh horrors along their path suggest that their reprieve may have come far too late.&lt;br /&gt; In the capital, Wirr is forced to contend with assassins and an increasingly hostile Administration as he controversially assumes the mantle of Northwarden, uncovering a mystery that draws into question everything commonly believed about the rebellion his father led twenty years ago. Meanwhile, Asha begins a secret investigation into the disappearance of the Shadows, determined to discover not only where they went but the origin of the Vessels that created them - and, ultimately, a cure.&lt;br /&gt; And with time against him as he races to fulfill the treacherous bargain with the Lyth, Caeden continues to wrestle with the impossibly heavy burdens of his past. Yet as more and more of his memories return, he begins to realise that the motivations of the two sides in this ancient war may not be as clear-cut as they first seemed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Licanius Trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Shadow of What Was Lost&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Echo of Things to Come&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It has been twenty years since the end of the war. The dictatorial Augurs—once thought of almost as gods—were overthrown and wiped out during the conflict, their much-feared powers mysteriously failing them. Those who had ruled under them, men and women with a lesser ability known as the Gift, avoided the Augurs' fate only by submitting themselves to the rebellion's Four Tenets. A representation of these laws is now written into the flesh of any who use the Gift, forcing those so marked into absolute obedience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a student of the Gifted, Davian suffers the consequences of a war fought—and lost—before he was born. Despised by most beyond the school walls, he and those around him are all but prisoners as they attempt to learn control of the Gift. Worse, as Davian struggles with his lessons, he knows that there is further to fall if he cannot pass his final tests. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Davian discovers he has the ability to wield the forbidden power of the Augurs, he sets into motion a chain of events that will change everything. To the north, an ancient enemy long thought defeated begins to stir. And to the west, a young man whose fate is intertwined with Davian’s wakes up in the forest, covered in blood and with no memory of who he is…</description>

  <description>This book is an investigation into the human lives at the heart of the American grocery store. What does it take to run the American supermarket? How do products get to shelves? Who sets the price? And who suffers the consequences of increased convenience and efficiency? In this exposé, author Benjamin Lorr pulls back the curtain on this highly secretive industry. Combining deep sourcing and immersive reporting, Lorr leads a wild investigation in which we learn the secrets of Trader Joe's success from Trader Joe himself, why truckers call their job "sharecropping on wheels," what it takes for a product to earn certification labels like "organic" and "fair trade," the struggles entrepreneurs face as they fight for shelf space, including essential tips, tricks, and traps for any new food business, the truth behind the alarming slave trade in the shrimp industry and much more.</description>

  <description>A rich, narrative explanation of the mathematics that has brought us machine learning and the ongoing explosion of artificial intelligence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Machine learning systems are making life-altering decisions for approving mortgage loans, determining whether a tumour is cancerous, or deciding whether someone gets bail. They now influence developments and discoveries in chemistry, biology, and physics—the study of genomes, extra-solar planets, even the intricacies of quantum systems. And all this before large language models such as ChatGPT came on the scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are living through a revolution in machine learning-powered AI that shows no signs of slowing down. This technology is based on relatively simple mathematical ideas, some of which go back centuries, including linear algebra and calculus, the stuff of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century mathematics. It took the birth and advancement of computer science and the kindling of 1990s computer chips designed for video games to ignite the explosion of AI that we see today. In this enlightening book, Anil Ananthaswamy explains the fundamental math behind machine learning, while suggesting intriguing links between artifical and natural intelligence. Might the same math underpin them both?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ananthaswamy resonantly concludes, to make safe and effective use of artificial intelligence, we need to understand its profound capabilities and limitations, the clues to which lie in the math that makes machine learning possible.</description>

  <description>The Scavenger species are circling. It is, truly, provably, the End Days for the Gzilt civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ancient people, organized on military principles and yet almost perversely peaceful, the Gzilt helped set up the Culture ten thousand years earlier and were very nearly one of its founding societies, deciding not to join only at the last moment. Now they've made the collective decision to follow the well-trodden path of millions of other civilizations; they are going to Sublime, elevating themselves to a new and almost infinitely more rich and complex existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid preparations though, the Regimental High Command is destroyed. Lieutenant Commander (reserve) Vyr Cossont appears to have been involved, and she is now wanted -- dead, not alive. Aided only by an ancient, reconditioned android and a suspicious Culture avatar, Cossont must complete her last mission given to her by the High Command. She must find the oldest person in the Culture, a man over nine thousand years old, who might have some idea what really happened all that time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the final days of the Gzilt civilization are likely to prove its most perilous.</description>

  <description>It is 4034. Humanity has made it to the stars. Fassin Taak, a Slow Seer at the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers, will be fortunate if he makes it to the end of the year. The Nasqueron Dwellers inhabit a gas giant on the outskirts of the galaxy, in a system awaiting its wormhole connection to the rest of civilization. In the meantime, they are dismissed as decadents living in a state of highly developed barbarism, hoarding data without order, hunting their own young &amp;amp; fighting pointless formal wars. Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of—part of the baroque hierarchy of the Mercatoria, the latest galactic hegemony— Taak has to travel again amongst the Dwellers. He is in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. But with each day that passes a war draws closer—a war threatening to overwhelm everything &amp;amp; everyone he's ever known.</description>

  <description>Magic is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discovered in the 1970s, magic is now a bona fide field of engineering. There's magic in heavy industry and magic in your home. It's what's next after electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Student mage Laura Ferno has designs on the future: her mother died trying to reach space using magic, and Laura wants to succeed where she failed. But first, she has to work out what went wrong. And who her mother really was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And whether, indeed, she's dead at all...</description>

  <description>By the end of the 30th century humanity has the capability to travel the universe, to journey beyond earth and beyond the confines of the vulnerable human frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The descendants of centuries of scientific, cultural and physical development divide into three: fleshers — true Homo sapiens; Gleisner robots — embodying human minds within machines that interact with the physical world; and polises — supercomputers teeming with intelligent software, containing the direct copies of billions of human personalities now existing only in the virtual reality of the polis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diaspora is the story of Yatima — a polis being created from random mutations of the Konishi polis base mind seed — and of humankind, Of an astrophysical accident that spurs the thousandfold cloning of the polises. Of the discovery of an alien race and of a kink in time that means humanity — whatever form it takes — will never again be threatened by acts of God.</description>

  <description>What's the most effective path to success in any domain? It's not what you think. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, &lt;i&gt;Range&lt;/i&gt; makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.</description>

  <description>With this groundbreaking novel, Maureen F. McHugh established herself as one of the decade's best science fiction writers. In its pages, we enter a post-revolution America, moving from the hyper-urbanized eastern seaboard to the Arctic bleakness of Baffin Island; from the new Imperial City to an agricultural commune on Mars. The overlapping lives of cyber-kite fliers, lonely colonists, illicit neural-pressball players, and organic engineers blend into a powerful, taut story of a young man's journey of discovery. This is a macroscopic world of microscopic intensity, one of the most brilliant visions of modern SF.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes a ghost of a chance is all you get.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Award-winning author Chris Moriarty returns to a dazzling cyber-noir far future in this gritty, high-stakes thriller where the only rule is “Evolve . . . or die.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Age of Man is ending. The UN’s sprawling interstellar empire is failing as its quantum teleportation network collapses, turning once-viable colonies into doomed island outposts. Humanity’s only hope of survival is the Drift: a mysterious region of space where faster-than-light travel—or something far stranger—seems possible. As mercenaries and pirates flock to the Drift, the cold war between the human-led UN and the clone-dominated Syndicates heats up. Whoever controls the Drift will chart the future course of human evolution—and no one wants to be left behind in a universe where the price of failure is extinction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the AI called Cohen ventures into the Drift, he dies—allegedly by his own hand—and his consciousness is scattered across the cosmos. Some of his ghosts are still self-aware. Some are insane. And one of them hides a secret worth killing for. Enter Major Catherine Li, Cohen’s human (well, partly human) lover, who embarks on a desperate search to solve the mystery of Cohen’s death—and put him back together. But Li isn’t the only one interested in Cohen’s ghosts. Astrid Avery, a by-the-book UN navy captain, is on the hunt. So is William Llewellyn, a pirate who has one of the ghosts in his head, which is slowly eating him alive. Even the ghosts have their own agendas. And lurking behind them all is a pitiless enemy who will stop at nothing to make sure the dead don’t walk again.</description>

  <description>Call Arkady a clone with a conscience. Or call him a traitor. A member of the space-faring Syndicates, Arkady has defected to Israel with a hot commodity: a genetic weapon powerful enough to wipe out humanity. But Israel’s not buying it. They’re selling it–and Arkady–to the highest bidder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the auction heats up, the Artificial Life Emancipation Front sends in Major Catherine Li. Drummed out of the Peacekeepers for executing Syndicate prisoners, Li has now literally hooked up with an AI who has lived many lifetimes and shunted through many bodies. But while they have their own conflicting loyalties to contend with, together they’re just one player in a mysterious high-stakes game….</description>

  <description>From a stunning new voice in hard science fiction comes the thrilling story of one woman’s quest to wrest truth from chaos, love from violence, and reality from illusion in a post-human universe of emergent AIs, genetic constructs, and illegal wetware...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spin State&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UN Peacekeeper Major Catherine Li has made thirty-seven faster-than-light jumps in her lifetime—and has probably forgotten more than most people remember. But that’s what backup hard drives are for. And Li should know; she’s been hacking her memory for fifteen years in order to pass as human. But no memory upgrade can prepare Li for what she finds on Compson’s World: a mining colony she once called home and to which she is sent after a botched raid puts her on the bad side of the powers that be. A dead physicist who just happens to be her cloned twin. A missing dataset that could change the interstellar balance of power and turn a cold war hot. And a mining “accident” that is starting to look more and more like murder...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Li is chasing a killer in an alien world miles underground where everyone has a secret. And one wrong turn in streamspace, one misstep in the dark alleys of blackmarket tech and interstellar espionage, one risky hookup with an AI could literally blow her mind.</description>

  <description>She said, We needed a tool. So I asked the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have always been whispers. Legends. The warrior who cannot be killed. Who’s seen a thousand civilizations rise and fall. He has had many names: Unute, Child of Lightning, Death himself. These days, he’s known simply as “B.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he wants to be able to die.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the present day, a U.S. black-ops group has promised him they can help with that. And all he needs to do is help them in return. But when an all-too-mortal soldier comes back to life, the impossible event ultimately points toward a force even more mysterious than B himself. One at least as strong. And one with a plan all its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A mind-blowing epic of ancient powers, modern war, and an outcast who cannot die. Combines Miéville’s singular style and creativity with Reeves’s haunting and soul-stirring narrative, unlike anything these two genre-bending pioneers have created before, inspired by the world of the BRZRKR comic books.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>What brings the Earth to life, and our own lives to an end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades, biology has been dominated by the study of genetic information. Information is important, but it is only part of what makes us alive. Our inheritance also includes our living metabolic network, a flame passed from generation to generation, right back to the origin of life. In &lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt;, biochemist Nick Lane reveals a scientific renaissance that is hiding in plain sight —how the same simple chemistry gives rise to life and causes our demise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lane is among the vanguard of researchers asking why the Krebs cycle, the “perfect circle” at the heart of metabolism, remains so elusive more than eighty years after its discovery. &lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt; is Lane’s voyage, as a biochemist, to find the inner meaning of the Krebs cycle—and its reverse—why it is still spinning at the heart of life and death today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lane reveals the beautiful, violent world within our cells, where hydrogen atoms are stripped from the carbon skeletons of food and fed to the ravenous beast of oxygen. Yet this same cycle, spinning in reverse, also created the chemical building blocks that enabled the emergence of life on our planet. Now it does both. How can the same pathway create and destroy? What might our study of the Krebs cycle teach us about the mysteries of aging and the hardest problem of all, consciousness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt; unites the story of our planet with the story of our cells—what makes us the way we are, and how it connects us to the origin of life. Enlivened by Lane’s talent for distilling and humanizing complex research, &lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt; offers an essential read for anyone fascinated by biology’s great mysteries. Life is at root a chemical phenomenon: this is its deep logic.</description>

  <description>This is where the dragons went. They lie... not dead, not asleep, but... dormant. And although the space they occupy isn't like normal space, nevertheless they are packed in tightly. They could put you in mind of a can of sardines, if you thought sardines were huge and scaly. And presumably, somewhere, there's a key...</description>

  <description>In 1956, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; prophesied that once global warming really kicked in, we could see parrots in the Antarctic. In 2010, when science deniers had control of the climate story, Senator James Inhofe and his family built an igloo on the Washington Mall and plunked a sign on top: AL GORE'S NEW HOME: HONK IF YOU LOVE CLIMATE CHANGE. In &lt;em&gt;The Parrot and the Igloo&lt;/em&gt;, best-selling author David Lipsky tells the astonishing story of how we moved from one extreme (the correct one) to the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With narrative sweep and a superb eye for character, Lipsky unfolds the dramatic narrative of the long, strange march of climate science. The story begins with a tale of three inventors—Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and Nikola Tesla—who made our technological world, not knowing what they had set into motion. Then there are the scientists who sounded the alarm once they identified carbon dioxide as the culprit of our warming planet. And we meet the hucksters, zealots, and crackpots who lied about that science and misled the public in ever more outrageous ways. Lipsky masterfully traces the evolution of climate denial, exposing how it grew out of early efforts to build a network of untruth about products like aspirin and cigarettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring an indelible cast of heroes and villains, mavericks and swindlers, &lt;em&gt;The Parrot and the Igloo&lt;/em&gt; delivers a real-life tragicomedy—one that captures the extraordinary dance of science, money, and the American character.</description>

  <description>The commander of the Earthpeople's Alliance journeyed into the bizarre depths of Transport Town to seek Rydra Wong, the cosmic poetess whose words reached across space and whose mind could perceive the meaning of all the world's tongues. And his request placed her into the heart of the vile interstellar war between the Alliance and the Invaders.&lt;br /&gt;The new weapon of the Invaders was Babel-17, a menacing hum clogging up Alliance space communications. Rydra had to decipher the communications power of Babel-17 before it could lead to intergalactic defeat. And to do that, she would have to be the target of the next outer-space attack.</description>

  <description>The human race has extended itself into the far reaches of our solar system -- and, in doing so, has developed into something remarkable. The inner system of the Met -- with its worlds connected by a vast living network of cables -- is supported by the repression and enslavement of humanity's progeny, nanotechnological artificial intelligences whom the tyrant Amés has declared non-human. But the longing for freedom cannot be denied. And now a line has been drawn at Neptune's moon Triton, where those who oppose Ame's and hisfearsome minions await the foretold return of a mysterious man of destiny and doom who has vanished into the backwater of the Met. But resistance will only ensure the unspeakable onslaught of the dictator's wrath -- a rage that will soon ravage the solar system and plunge all of humankind into the fury of total war.</description>

  <description>Two top women gladiators fight for their freedom within a depraved private prison system not so far-removed from America's own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loretta Thurwar and Hamara "Hurricane Staxxx" Stacker are the stars of Chain-Gang All-Stars, the cornerstone of CAPE, or Criminal Action Penal Entertainment, a highly-popular, highly-controversial, profit-raising program in America's increasingly dominant private prison industry. It's the return of the gladiators and prisoners are competing for the ultimate prize: their freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In CAPE, prisoners travel as Links in Chain-Gangs, competing in death-matches for packed arenas with righteous protestors at the gates. Thurwar and Staxxx, both teammates and lovers, are the fan favorites. And if all goes well, Thurwar will be free in just a few matches, a fact she carries as heavily as her lethal hammer. As she prepares to leave her fellow Links, she considers how she might help preserve their humanity, in defiance of these so-called games, but CAPE's corporate owners will stop at nothing to protect their status quo and the obstacles they lay in Thurwar's path have devastating consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving from the Links in the field to the protestors to the CAPE employees and beyond, &lt;i&gt;Chain-Gang All-Stars&lt;/i&gt; is a kaleidoscopic, excoriating look at the American prison system's unholy alliance of systemic racism, unchecked capitalism, and mass incarceration, and a clear-eyed reckoning with what freedom in this country really means.</description>

  <description>GOD IS DEAD, his corpse hidden in the catacombs beneath Mordew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the slums of the sea-battered city a young boy called Nathan Treeves lives with his parents, eking out a meagre existence by picking treasures from the Living Mud and the half-formed, short-lived creatures it spawns. Until one day his desperate mother sells him to the mysterious Master of Mordew. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Master derives his magical power from feeding on the corpse of God. But Nathan, despite his fear and lowly station, has his own strength – and it is greater than the Master has ever known. Great enough to destroy everything the Master has built. If only Nathan can discover how to use it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is that the Master begins to scheme against him – and Nathan has to fight his way through the betrayals, secrets, and vendettas of the city where God was murdered, and darkness reigns… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… WELCOME TO MORDEW – THE FIRST IN A MONUMENTAL NEW TRILOGY FROM THE WELLCOME BOOK PRIZE-SHORTLISTED AUTHOR, ALEX PHEBY</description>

  <description>Winner of the 2023 PROSE Award for Excellence in Biological and Life Sciences and the 2023 Chautauqua Prize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N amed a New York Times Notable Book and a Best Book of the Year by The Economist , Oprah Daily, BookPage, Book Riot, the New York Public Library, and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Song of the Cell , the extraordinary author of the Pulitzer Prize–winning The Emperor of All Maladies and the #1 New York Times bestseller The Gene “blends cutting-edge research, impeccable scholarship, intrepid reporting, and gorgeous prose into an encyclopedic study that reads like a literary page-turner” ( Oprah Daily ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mukherjee begins this magnificent story in the late 1600s, when a distinguished English polymath, Robert Hooke, and an eccentric Dutch cloth-merchant, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek looked down their handmade microscopes. What they saw introduced a radical concept that swept through biology and medicine, touching virtually every aspect of the two sciences, and altering both forever. It was the fact that complex living organisms are assemblages of tiny, self-contained, self-regulating units. Our organs, our physiology, our selves—hearts, blood, brains—are built from these compartments. Hooke christened them “ cells. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The discovery of cells—and the reframing of the human body as a cellular ecosystem—announced the birth of a new kind of medicine based on the therapeutic manipulations of cells. A hip fracture, a cardiac arrest, Alzheimer’s dementia, AIDS, pneumonia, lung cancer, kidney failure, arthritis, COVID pneumonia—all could be reconceived as the results of cells, or systems of cells, functioning abnormally. And all could be perceived as loci of cellular therapies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with writing so vivid, lucid, and suspenseful that complex science becomes thrilling, The Song of the Cell tells the story of how scientists discovered cells, began to understand them, and are now using that knowledge to create new humans. Told in six parts, and laced with Mukherjee’s own experience as a researcher, a doctor, and a prolific reader, The Song of the Cell is both panoramic and intimate—a masterpiece on what it means to be human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In an account both lyrical and capacious, Mukherjee takes us through an evolution of human from the seventeenth-century discovery that humans are made up of cells to our cutting-edge technologies for manipulating and deploying cells for therapeutic purposes” ( The New Yorker).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;JADE CITY is &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;a gripping &lt;i&gt;Godfather&lt;/i&gt;-esque saga of intergenerational blood feuds, vicious politics, magic, and kungfu.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kaul family is one of two crime syndicates that control the island of Kekon. It's the only place in the world that produces rare magical jade, which grants those with the right training and heritage superhuman abilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Green Bone clans of honorable jade-wearing warriors once protected the island from foreign invasion--but nowadays, in a bustling post-war metropolis full of fast cars and foreign money, Green Bone families like the Kauls are primarily involved in commerce, construction, and the everyday upkeep of the districts under their protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the simmering tension between the Kauls and their greatest rivals erupts into open violence in the streets, the outcome of this clan war will determine the fate of all Green Bones and the future of Kekon itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A pioneering researcher transforms our understanding of trauma and offers a bold new paradigm for healing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world's foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In &lt;i&gt;The Body Keeps the Score&lt;/i&gt;, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers' capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain's natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk's own research and that of other leading specialists, &lt;i&gt;The Body Keeps the Score&lt;/i&gt; exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal—and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;2019 was the last great year for the world economy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For generations, everything has been getting faster, better, and cheaper. Finally, we reached the point that almost anything you could ever want could be sent to your home within days - even hours - of when you decided you wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America made that happen, but now America has lost interest in keeping it going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Globe-spanning supply chains are only possible with the protection of the U.S. Navy. The American dollar underpins internationalized energy and financial markets. Complex, innovative industries were created to satisfy American consumers. American security policy forced warring nations to lay down their arms. &lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt; of people have been fed and educated as the American-led trade system spread across the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this was artificial. All this was temporary. All this is ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The End of the World is Just the Beginning, &lt;/em&gt;author and geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan maps out the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; world: a world where countries or regions will have no choice but to make their own goods, grow their own food, secure their own energy, fight their own battles, and do it all with populations that are both shrinking and aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of countries that make it all work is smaller than you think. Which means everything about our interconnected world - from how we manufacture products, to how we grow food, to how we keep the lights on, to how we shuttle stuff about, to how we pay for it all - is about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A world ending. A world beginning. Zeihan brings readers along for an illuminating (and a bit terrifying) ride packed with foresight, wit, and his trademark irreverence.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm not 100% convinced, but I love the specificity, ambition, and depth. I wish more books were like this.<br /><br />The basic argument as I understood it: the US is pulling back from protecting worldwide trade, so worldwide trade costs will skyrocket, so very bad things will happen.<br /><br />The basic structure makes sense to me. A few questions:<br />1. Is the US pullback an irreversible a one-way trend? I.e. as negative effects emerge, it's plausible that the trend would reverse, whether or not the rationale for the reversal is explicit or logical.<br />2. People have generally proven far better at substitutions and workarounds than this kind of structural + statistical analysis predicts. Given the interconnectedness of all these domains, it seems very difficult to find alternate approaches for all of them, but even if significant disruption is unavoidable, the bottom may not be as low as this predicts.<br />3. In general, betting on ruin has been a bad bet. I do think the demographic arguments marshaled here are convincing that this time really is different, but I can't ignore my priors.]]>

  <description>The historical record crowns success. Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy's &lt;i&gt;Profiles in Courage&lt;/i&gt;, Giorgio Vasari's &lt;i&gt;Lives of the Artists&lt;/i&gt;, and Samuel Johnson's &lt;i&gt;Lives of the Poets&lt;/i&gt; are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Collins' &lt;i&gt;Banvard's Folly&lt;/i&gt; is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as "The Three Mile Painting") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. René Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed "William Shakespeare" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collins' love for what he calls the "forgotten ephemera of genius" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in &lt;i&gt;Banvard's Folly&lt;/i&gt; sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this exhilarating novel, two friends—often in love, but never lovers—come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, &lt;i&gt; Ichigo&lt;/i&gt;. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow&lt;/i&gt; is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.</description>

      <![CDATA[Solid. Been a while since I read this kind of contemporary fiction. Little thing that bugged me: lots of references to specific games accompanied by one line explanations. The impact of the references can’t be captured in quick summaries, and the summaries weigh down the prose. Would have been better to fully commit.]]>

  <description>The bold new work from award-winning author &lt;b&gt;Adrian Tchaikovsky&lt;/b&gt;  - a smart, funny tale of time-travel and paradox&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the end of time. It’s a perfect day.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Nobody remembers how the Causality War started. Really, there’s no-one &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; remember, and nothing for them to remember if there were; that’s sort of the point. We were time warriors, and we broke time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I was the one who ended it. Ended the fighting, tidied up the damage as much as I could. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Then I came here, to the end of it all, and gave myself a mission: to never let it happen again.</description>

  <description>You know your product is awesome—but does anybody else? Forget everything you thought you knew about positioning. Successfully connecting your product with consumers isn’t a matter of following trends, comparing yourself to the competition or trying to attract the widest customer base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is it? April Dunford, positioning guru and tech exec, will enlighten you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her new book, &lt;i&gt;Obviously Awesome&lt;/i&gt;, shows you how to find your product’s “secret sauce”—and then sell that sauce to those who crave it. Having spent years as a startup executive (with 16 product launches under her belt) and a consultant (who’s worked on dozens more), Dunford speaks with authority about breaking through the noise of a crowded market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punctuated with witty anecdotes and compelling case studies, Dunford’s book is at once entertaining and illuminating. Among the invaluable lessons you’ll learn are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Five Components of Effective Positioning&lt;br /&gt;- How to instantly connect an audience to your offering’s value&lt;br /&gt;- How to choose the best market for your products&lt;br /&gt;- How to use three distinct styles of positioning to your advantage&lt;br /&gt;- How to leverage market trends to help buyers understand why making a purchase is important right now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you’re an entrepreneur, marketer or salesperson struggling to bring inventive products to market, Dunford’s insights will help you find your awesome, so that your customers can too.</description>

  <description>Most startups end in failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Almost every failed startup has a product. What failed startups don't have are enough customers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founders and employees fail to spend time thinking about (and working on) traction in the same way they work on building a product. This shortsighted approach has startups trying random tactics - some ads, a blog post or two - in an unstructured way that's guaranteed to fail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book changes that. &lt;b&gt;Traction Book provides startup founders and employees with the framework successful companies have used to get traction.&lt;/b&gt; It allows you to think about which marketing channels make sense for you, given your industry and company stage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This framework has been used by founders like &lt;b&gt;Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit), Paul English (Kayak.com), and Alex Pachikov (Evernote)&lt;/b&gt; to build some of the biggest companies and organizations in the world. We interviewed each of the above founders - along with 35+ others - and pulled out the repeatable tactics and strategies they used to get traction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then cover every possible marketing channel you can use to get traction, and show you which channels will be your key to growth. This book shows you how to grow at a time when getting traction is more important than ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are the channels we cover in the book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viral Marketing &lt;br /&gt;Public Relations (PR) &lt;br /&gt;Unconventional PR &lt;br /&gt;Search Engine Marketing (SEM) &lt;br /&gt;Social and Display Ads &lt;br /&gt;Offline Ads &lt;br /&gt;Search Engine Optimization (SEO) &lt;br /&gt;Content Marketing &lt;br /&gt;Email Marketing &lt;br /&gt;Engineering as Marketing &lt;br /&gt;Target Market Blogs &lt;br /&gt;Business Development (BD) &lt;br /&gt;Sales &lt;br /&gt;Affiliate Programs &lt;br /&gt;Existing Platforms &lt;br /&gt;Trade Shows &lt;br /&gt;Offline Events &lt;br /&gt;Speaking Engagements &lt;br /&gt;Community Building&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book draws on interviews with the following individuals: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy Wales, Co-founder of Wikipedia &lt;br /&gt;Alexis Ohanian, Co-founder of reddit &lt;br /&gt;Eric Ries, Author of The Lean Startup &lt;br /&gt;Rand Fishkin, Founder of SEOmoz &lt;br /&gt;Noah Kagan, Founder of AppSumo &lt;br /&gt;Patrick McKenzie, CEO of Bingo Card Creator &lt;br /&gt;Sam Yagan, Co-founder of OkCupid &lt;br /&gt;Andrew Chen, Investor at 500 Startups &lt;br /&gt;Justin Kan, Founder of Justin.tv &lt;br /&gt;Mark Cramer, CEO of SurfCanyon &lt;br /&gt;Colin Nederkoorn, CEO of Customer.io &lt;br /&gt;Jason Cohen, Founder of WP Engine &lt;br /&gt;Chris Fralic, Partner at First Round &lt;br /&gt;Paul English, CEO of Kayak.com &lt;br /&gt;Rob Walling, Founder of MicroConf &lt;br /&gt;Brian Riley, Co-founder of SlidePad &lt;br /&gt;Steve Welch, Co-founder of DreamIt &lt;br /&gt;Jason Kincaid, Blogger at TechCrunch &lt;br /&gt;Nikhil Sethi, Founder of Adaptly &lt;br /&gt;Rick Perreault, CEO of Unbounce &lt;br /&gt;Alex Pachikov, Co-founder of Evernote &lt;br /&gt;David Skok, Partner at Matrix &lt;br /&gt;Ashish Kundra, CEO of myZamana &lt;br /&gt;David Hauser, Founder of Grasshopper &lt;br /&gt;Matt Monahan, CEO of Inflection &lt;br /&gt;Jeff Atwood, Co-founder of Discourse &lt;br /&gt;Dan Martell, CEO of Clarity.fm &lt;br /&gt;Chris McCann, Founder of StartupDigest &lt;br /&gt;Ryan Holiday, Exec at American Apparel &lt;br /&gt;Todd Vollmer, Enterprise Sales Veteran &lt;br /&gt;Sandi MacPherson, Founder of Quibb &lt;br /&gt;Andrew Warner, Founder of Mixergy &lt;br /&gt;Sean Murphy, Founder of SKMurphy &lt;br /&gt;Satish Dharmaraj, Partner at Redpoint &lt;br /&gt;Garry Tan, Partner at Y Combinator &lt;br /&gt;Steve Barsh, CEO of Packlate &lt;br /&gt;Michael Bodekaer, Co-founder of Smart Launch &lt;br /&gt;Zack Linford, Founder of Optimozo</description>

  <description>From the New York Times-bestselling author of How Not to Be Wrong—himself a world-class geometer—a far-ranging exploration of the power of geometry, which turns out to help us think better about practically everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How should a democracy choose its representatives? How can you stop a pandemic from sweeping the world? How do computers learn to play Go, and why is learning Go so much easier for them than learning to read a sentence? Can ancient Greek proportions predict the stock market? (Sorry, no.) What should your kids learn in school if they really want to learn to think? All these are questions about geometry. For real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're like most people, geometry is a sterile and dimly remembered exercise you gladly left behind in the dust of ninth grade, along with your braces and active romantic interest in pop singers. If you recall any of it, it's plodding through a series of miniscule steps only to prove some fact about triangles that was obvious to you in the first place. That's not geometry. Okay, it is geometry, but only a tiny part, which has as much to do with geometry in all its flush modern richness as conjugating a verb has to do with a great novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shape reveals the geometry underneath some of the most important scientific, political, and philosophical problems we face. Geometry Where are things? Which things are near each other? How can you get from one thing to another thing? Those are important questions. The word "geometry," from the Greek for "measuring the world." If anything, that's an undersell. Geometry doesn't just measure the world—it explains it. Shape shows us how.</description>

  <description>An epic account of the decades-long battle to control what has emerged as the world's most critical resource—microchip technology—with the United States and China increasingly in conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be surprised to learn that microchips are the new oil—the scarce resource on which the modern world depends. Today, military, economic, and geopolitical power are built on a foundation of computer chips. Virtually &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;— from missiles to microwaves, smartphones to the stock market — runs on chips. Until recently, America designed and built the fastest chips and maintained its lead as the #1 superpower. Now, America's edge is slipping, undermined by competitors in Taiwan, Korea, Europe, and, above all, China. Today, as &lt;i&gt;Chip War&lt;/i&gt; reveals, China, which spends more money each year importing chips than it spends importing oil, is pouring billions into a chip-building initiative to catch up to the US. At stake is America's military superiority and economic prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economic historian Chris Miller explains how the semiconductor came to play a critical role in modern life and how the U.S. become dominant in chip design and manufacturing and applied this technology to military systems. America's victory in the Cold War and its global military dominance stems from its ability to harness computing power more effectively than any other power. But here, too, China is catching up, with its chip-building ambitions and military modernization going hand in hand. America has let key components of the chip-building process slip out of its grasp, contributing not only to a worldwide chip shortage but also a new Cold War with a superpower adversary that is desperate to bridge the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illuminating, timely, and fascinating, &lt;i&gt;Chip War&lt;/i&gt; shows that, to make sense of the current state of politics, economics, and technology, we must first understand the vital role played by chips.</description>

  <description>The story of how the East India Company took over large swaths of Asia, and the devastating results of the corporation running a country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In August 1765, the East India Company defeated the young Mughal emperor and set up, in his place, a government run by English traders who collected taxes through means of a private army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional company and became something much more unusual: an international corporation transformed into an aggressive colonial power. Over the course of the next 47 years, the company's reach grew until almost all of India south of Delhi was effectively ruled from a boardroom in the city of London.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans; they incinerate them. With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant. She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet with every day that passes, the war outside grows deadlier; the kingdom's protective wards are failing; and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.</description>

  <description>Dr. Cliff Miyashiro arrives in the Arctic Circle to continue his recently deceased daughter's research, only to discover a virus, newly unearthed from melting permafrost. The plague unleashed reshapes life on earth for generations. Yet even while struggling to counter this destructive force, humanity stubbornly persists in myriad moving and ever inventive ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among those adjusting to this new normal are an aspiring comedian, employed by a theme park designed for terminally ill children, who falls in love with a mother trying desperately to keep her son alive; a scientist who, having failed to save his own son from the plague, gets a second chance at fatherhood when one of his test subjects-a pig-develops human speech; a man who, after recovering from his own coma, plans a block party for his neighbours who have also woken up to find that they alone have survived their families; and a widowed painter and her teenaged granddaughter who must set off on cosmic quest to locate a new home planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From funerary skyscrapers to hotels for the dead, How High We Go in the Dark follows a cast of intricately linked characters spanning hundreds of years as humanity endeavours to restore the delicate balance of the world. This is a story of unshakable hope that crosses literary lines to give us a world rebuilding itself through an endless capacity for love, resilience and reinvention. Wonderful and disquieting, dreamlike and all too possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A terrible, wonderful, heart-breaking story about hope and humanity and a young girl who tries to save the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie is a very special girl. Dr Caldwell calls her 'our little genius'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning, Melanie waits in her cell to be collected for class. When they come for her, Sergeant keeps his gun pointing at her while two of his people strap her into the wheelchair. She thinks they don't like her. She jokes that she won't bite, but they don't laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie loves school. She loves learning about spelling and sums and the world outside the classroom and the children's cells. She tells her favourite teacher all the things she'll do when she grows up. Melanie doesn't know why this makes Miss Justineau look sad.</description>

  <description>Erasmas, 'Raz', is a young avout living in the Concent, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers. Three times during history's darkest epochs, violence has invaded and devastated the cloistered community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they now prepare to open the Concent's gates to the outside world, in celebration of a once-a-decade rite. Suddenly, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world - as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet...and beyond.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Alan Moore–one of the most influential writers in the history of comics–nine incredibles stories that take us to the fantastical underside of reality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his first-ever short story collection, which spans forty years of work, Alan Moore presents a series of wildly different and equally unforgettable characters who discover–and in some cases even make and unmake–the various uncharted parts of existence.&lt;br /&gt; In "Hypothetical Lizard," two concubines in a brothel of fantastical specialists fall in love with tragic ramifications. In "Not Even Legend," a paranormal study group is infiltrated by one of the otherworldly beings they seek to investigate. In "Illuminations," a nostalgic older man decides to visit a seaside resort from his youth and finds the past all too close at hand. And in the monumental novella "What We Can Know About Thunderman," which charts the surreal and Kafkaesque history of the comics industry's major players over the last seventy-five years, Moore reveals the dark, beating heart of the superhero business.&lt;br /&gt; From ghosts and otherworldly creatures to theoretical Boltzmann brains fashioning the universe at the big bang, &lt;i&gt;Illuminations&lt;/i&gt; is exactly that–a series of bright, startling tales from a contemporary legend that reveal the full power of imagination and magic.</description>

  <description>"This is the story of the two enormously gifted, fatally flawed men: the brilliant, self-important Fritz Haber and the reclusive, alcoholic Carl Bosch. Together they discovered a way to make bread out of air, built city-sized factories, controlled world markets, and saved millions of lives. Their invention continues to feed us today; without it, more than two billion people would starve." But their epochal triumph came at a price we are still paying. The Haber-Bosch process was also used to make the gunpowder and high explosives that killed millions during the two world wars. Both men were vilified during their lives; both, disillusioned and disgraced, died tragically. Today we face the other unintended consequences of their discovery massive nitrogen pollution and a growing pandemic of obesity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Gregory Zuckerman, the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Greatest Trade Ever &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Frackers&lt;/i&gt;, answers the question investors have been asking for decades: How did Jim Simons do it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shortlisted for the &lt;/i&gt;Financial Times&lt;i&gt;/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Simons is the greatest money maker in modern financial history. No other investor--Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, or George Soros--can touch his record. Since 1988, Renaissance's signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent. The firm has earned profits of more than $100 billion; Simons is worth twenty-three billion dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on unprecedented access to Simons and dozens of current and former employees, Zuckerman, a veteran Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, tells the gripping story of how a world-class mathematician and former code breaker mastered the market. Simons pioneered a data-driven, algorithmic approach that's sweeping the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Renaissance became a market force, its executives began influencing the world beyond finance. Simons became a major figure in scientific research, education, and liberal politics. Senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency, placing Steve Bannon in the campaign and funding Trump's victorious 2016 effort. Mercer also impacted the campaign behind Brexit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Man Who Solved the Market&lt;/i&gt; is a portrait of a modern-day Midas who remade markets in his own image, but failed to anticipate how his success would impact his firm and his country. It's also a story of what Simons's revolution means for the rest of us.</description>

  <description>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask, she must answer. A steerswoman's knowledge is shared with any who request it; no steerswoman may refuse a question, and no steerswoman may answer with anything but the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if she asks, you must answer. It is the other side of tradition's contract -- and if you refuse the question, or lie, no steerswoman will ever again answer even your most casual question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, the steerswomen — always seeking, always investigating — have gathered more and more knowledge about the world they traveled, and they share that knowledge freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day that the steerswoman Rowan begins asking innocent questions about one small, lovely, inexplicable object…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her discoveries grow stranger and deeper, and more dangerous, until suddenly she finds she must flee or fight for her life. Or worse -- lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because one kind of knowledge has always been denied the the steerswomen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic.</description>

  <description>The universe shifts and changes: suddenly you understand, you get it, and are filled with a sense of wonder. That moment of understanding drives the greatest science-fiction stories and lies at the heart of &lt;i&gt;Engineering Infinity&lt;/i&gt;. Whether it's coming up hard against the speed of light - and, with it, the enormity of the universe - realising that terraforming a distant world is harder and more dangerous than you'd ever thought, or simply realizing that a hitchhiker on a starship consumes fuel and oxygen with tragic results, it's hard science-fiction where sense of wonder is most often found and where science-fiction's true heart lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This exciting and innovative science-fiction anthology collects together stories by some of the biggest names in the field including Gwyneth Jones, Stephen Baxter and Charles Stross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents:&lt;br /&gt;- Beyond the Gernsback Continuum... by Jonathan Strahan&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Malak&lt;/i&gt; by Peter Watts&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Watching the Music Dance&lt;/i&gt; by Kristine Kathryn Rusch&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Laika's Ghost&lt;/i&gt; by Karl Schroeder&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;The Invasion of Venus&lt;/i&gt; by Stephen Baxter&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;The Server and the Dragon&lt;/i&gt; by Hannu Rajaniemi&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Bit Rot&lt;/i&gt; by Charles Stross&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Creatures with Wings&lt;/i&gt; by Kathleen Ann Goonan&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Walls of Flesh, Bars of Bone&lt;/i&gt; by Damien Broderick and Barbara Lamar&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Mantis&lt;/i&gt; by Robert Reed&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Judgement Eve&lt;/i&gt; by John C. Wright&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;A Soldier of the City&lt;/i&gt; by David Moles&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Mercies&lt;/i&gt; by Gregory Benford&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;The Ki-anna&lt;/i&gt; by Gwyneth Jones&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;The Birds and the Bees and the Gasoline Trees&lt;/i&gt; by John Barnes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover illustration by Stephan Martiniere</description>

  <description>Combining complex science with skillfully executed prose, these edgy, award-winning tales explore the shifting border between the known and the alien. The beauty and peril of technology and the passion and penalties of conviction merge in narratives that are by turns dark, satiric, and introspective. Among these bold storylines: a seemingly humanized monster from John Carpenter’s &lt;i&gt;The Thing&lt;/i&gt; reveals the true villains in an Antarctic showdown; an artificial intelligence shields a biologically enhanced prodigy from her overwhelmed parents; a deep-sea diver discovers her true nature lies not within the confines of her mission but in the depths of her psyche; a court psychologist analyzes a psychotic graduate student who has learned to reprogram reality itself; and a father tries to hold his broken family together in the wake of an ongoing assault by sentient rainstorms. Gorgeously saturnine and exceptionally powerful, these collected fictions are both intensely thought-provoking and impossible to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Things"&lt;br /&gt;"The Island" &lt;br /&gt;"The Second Coming of Jasmine Fitzgerald"&lt;br /&gt;"A Word for Heathens"&lt;br /&gt;"Home"&lt;br /&gt;"The Eyes of God" &lt;br /&gt;"Flesh Made Word"&lt;br /&gt;"Nimbus"&lt;br /&gt;"Mayfly" (with Derryl Murphy) &lt;br /&gt;"Ambassador"&lt;br /&gt;"Hillcrest vs. Velikovsky"&lt;br /&gt;"Repeating the Past"&lt;br /&gt;"A Niche"&lt;br /&gt;"Outtro: En Route to Dystopia with the Angry Optimist"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Arthur C. Clarke award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Children of Time&lt;/i&gt; brings us the second novel in an extraordinary space opera trilogy about humanity on the brink of extinction, and how one man's discovery will save or destroy us all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After eighty years of fragile peace, the Architects are back, wreaking havoc as they consume entire planets. In the past, Originator artefacts – vestiges of a long-vanished civilization – could save a world from annihilation. This time, the Architects have discovered a way to circumvent these protective relics. Suddenly, no planet is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing impending extinction, the Human Colonies are in turmoil. While some believe a unified front is the only way to stop the Architects, others insist humanity should fight alone. And there are those who would seek to benefit from the fractured politics of war – even as the Architects loom ever closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idris, who has spent decades running from the horrors of his past, finds himself thrust back onto the battlefront. As an Intermediary, he could be one of the few to turn the tide of war. With a handful of allies, he searches for a weapon that could push back the Architects and save the galaxy. But to do so, he must return to the nightmarish unspace, where his mind was broken and remade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Idris discovers there will change everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I am going to make a momentous decision. Most likely it is a bad decision. Certainly it may be the last major decision I ever make.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynesse is the lowly Fourth Daughter of the queen, and always getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a demon is terrorizing the land, and now she’s an adult (albeit barely) with responsibilities (she tells herself). Although she still gets in the way, she understands that the only way to save her people is to invoke the pact between her family and the Elder sorcerer who has inhabited the local tower for as long as her people have lived here (though none in living memory has approached it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Elder Nyr isn’t a sorcerer, and he is forbidden to help, and his knowledge of science tells him the threat cannot possibly be a demon. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Karl Schroeder, author of &lt;i&gt;Lockstep&lt;/i&gt;, comes the near-future, science fiction, hacker’s heist, &lt;i&gt;Stealing Worlds&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sura Neelin is on the run from her creditors, from her past, and her father’s murderers. She can’t get a job, she can’t get a place to live, she can’t even walk down the the total surveillance society that is mid-21st century America means that every camera and every pair of smart glasses is her enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Sura might have a chance in the alternate reality of the games. People can disappear in the LARP game worlds, into the alternate economy of Notchcoin and blockchains. The people who build the games also program the surveillance networks—she just needs an introduction, and the skills to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, she has very valuable skills, and some very surprising friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Arthur C. Clarke award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Children of Time&lt;/i&gt; brings us an extraordinary space opera about humanity on the brink of extinction, and how one man's discovery will save or destroy us all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The war is over. Its heroes forgotten. Until one chance discovery . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idris has neither aged nor slept since they remade him in the war. And one of humanity's heroes now scrapes by on a freelance salvage vessel, to avoid the attention of greater powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After earth was destroyed, mankind created a fighting elite to save their species, enhanced humans such as Idris. In the silence of space they could communicate, mind-to-mind, with the enemy. Then their alien aggressors, the Architects, simply disappeared—and Idris and his kind became obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, fifty years later, Idris and his crew have discovered something strange abandoned in space. It's clearly the work of the Architects—but are they returning? And if so, why? Hunted by gangsters, cults and governments, Idris and his crew race across the galaxy hunting for answers. For they now possess something of incalculable value, that many would kill to obtain.</description>

  <description>Fantascienza - racconto lungo (46 pagine) - Un essere vivente grande come un sistema solare e con la massa di un piccolo pianeta. E intelligente. Premio Hugo 2010&lt;br /&gt;Quella strana intermittenza nella luce della stella li aveva portati a una scoperta c'era un essere vivente, lì nello spazio. Attorno al sole. Un sottile strato, non più di qualche millimetro, che circondava come una sfera tutta la stella, a 1,4 unità astronomiche di distanza. Un'essere vivente grande come un sistema solare e con la massa di un piccolo pianeta. E intelligente. Ma quando poteva essere intelligente un essere con una quantità di cellule cerebrali equivalente a quella di dieci miliardi di cervelli umani?&lt;br /&gt;Canadese, classe 1958,  Peter Watts  ha vinto il premio Hugo nel 2010 col racconto  L’isola , ma c'era già arrivato vicino nel 2006 col romanzo  Blindsight . Biologo specializzato nei mammiferi marini, Watts ha sfruttato le sue conoscenze scientifiche nel romanzo con cui ha esordito,  Starfish , al quale ha dato finora tre seguiti. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Kaiju Preservation Society&lt;/i&gt; is John Scalzi's first standalone adventure since the conclusion of his &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Interdependency trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When COVID-19 sweeps through New York City, Jamie Gray is stuck as a dead-end driver for food delivery apps. That is, until Jamie makes a delivery to an old acquaintance, Tom, who works at what he calls "an animal rights organization." Tom's team needs a last-minute grunt to handle things on their next field visit. Jamie, eager to do anything, immediately signs on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Tom doesn't tell Jamie is that the animals his team cares for are not here on Earth. Not our Earth, at at least. In an alternate dimension, massive dinosaur-like creatures named Kaiju roam a warm and human-free world. They're the universe's largest and most dangerous panda and they're in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not just the Kaiju Preservation Society that's found its way to the alternate world. Others have, too--and their carelessness could cause millions back on our Earth to die.</description>

  <description>Lillian and Madison were unlikely roommates and yet inseparable friends at their elite boarding school. But then Lillian had to leave the school unexpectedly in the wake of a scandal and they’ve barely spoken since. Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison’s twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker. However, there’s a catch: the twins spontaneously combust when they get agitated, flames igniting from their skin in a startling but beautiful way. Lillian is convinced Madison is pulling her leg, but it’s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of her dead-end life at home, the life that has consistently disappointed her, Lillian figures she has nothing to lose. Over the course of one humid, demanding summer, Lillian and the twins learn to trust each other—and stay cool—while also staying out of the way of Madison’s buttoned-up politician husband. Surprised by her own ingenuity yet unused to the intense feelings of protectiveness she feels for them, Lillian ultimately begins to accept that she needs these strange children as much as they need her—urgently and fiercely. Couldn’t this be the start of the amazing life she’d always hoped for?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You are the next step in human evolution.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Logan Ramsay isn’t sure if anything’s different. He just feels a little . . . sharper. Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking. Reading a bit faster, memorizing better, needing less sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before long, he can’t deny it: Something’s happening to his brain. To his body. He’s starting to see the world, and those around him—even those he loves most—in whole new ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, Logan’s genome has been hacked. And there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan, one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large—at a terrifying cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in the world capable of stopping what’s been set in motion. But to have a chance at winning this war, he’ll have to become something other than himself. Maybe even something other than human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even as he’s fighting, he can’t help wondering: what if humanity’s only hope for a future really does lie in engineering our own evolution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intimate in scale yet epic in scope, &lt;i&gt;Upgrade&lt;/i&gt; is an intricately plotted, lightning-fast tale that charts one man’s thrilling transformation, even as it asks us to ponder the limits of our humanity—and our boundless potential.</description>

  <description>The Mom Test is a quick, practical guide that will save you time, money, and heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you shouldn't ask your mom whether your business is a good idea, because she loves you and will lie to you. This is technically true, but it misses the point. You shouldn't ask anyone if your business is a good idea. It's a bad question and everyone will lie to you at least a little . As a matter of fact, it's not their responsibility to tell you the truth. It's your responsibility to find it and it's worth doing right .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking to customers is one of the foundational skills of both Customer Development and Lean Startup. We all know we're supposed to do it, but nobody seems willing to admit that it's easy to screw up and hard to do right. This book is going to show you how customer conversations go wrong and how you can do better.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What if you could take a vacation to your past?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;With her celebrated humor, insight, and heart, beloved &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller Emma Straub offers her own twist on traditional time travel tropes, and a different kind of love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the eve of her 40th birthday, Alice's life isn't terrible&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; She likes her job, even if it isn't exactly the one she expected. She's happy with her apartment, her romantic status, her independence, and she adores her lifelong best friend. But her father is ailing, and it feels to her as if something is missing. When she wakes up the next morning she finds herself back in 1996, reliving her 16th birthday. But it isn't just her adolescent body that shocks her, or seeing her high school crush, it's her dad: the vital, charming, 40-something version of her father with whom she is reunited. Now armed with a new perspective on her own life and his, some past events take on new meaning. Is there anything that she would change if she could?</description>

  <description>Rorty seeks to tie philosophy’s past to its future by connecting what he sees as the positive (and neglected) contributions of the American pragmatic philosophers to contemporary European developments. What emerges from his explorations is a revivified version of pragmatism that offers new hope for the future of philosophy.“Rorty’s dazzling tour through the history of modern philosophy, and his critical account of its present state (the best general introduction in print), is actually an argument that what we consider perennial problems--mind and body, consciousness and objects, the foundations of knowledge, the fact/value distinction--are merely the dead-ends this picture leads us into.” Los Angeles Times Book Review “It can immediately be said that Consequences of Pragmatism must be read by both those who believe that they agree and those who believe that they disagree with Richard Rorty. [He] is far and away the most provocative philosophical writer working in North America today, and Consequences of Pragmatism should make this claim even stronger.”The Review of Metaphysics “Philosophy, for Rorty, is a form of writing, a literary genre, closer to literary criticism than anything else, a criticism which takes for one of its major concerns the texts of the past recognized as philosophical: it interprets interpretations. If anyone doubts the continued vigor and continuing relevance of American pragmatism, the doubts can be laid to rest by reading this book.” Religious Studies Review</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A grand tour through the hidden realms of animal senses that will transform the way you perceive the world&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;--from the Pulitzer Prize-winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;I Contain Multitudes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. But every animal is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense world. This book welcomes us into a previously unfathomable dimension--the world as it is truly perceived by other animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth's magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and humans that wield sonar like bats. We discover that a crocodile's scaly face is as sensitive as a lover's fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision. We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. We listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries which lie unsolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;An Immense World&lt;/i&gt;, author and acclaimed science journalist Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. Because in order to understand our world we don't need to travel to other places; we need to see through other eyes.</description>

  <description>The modern classic of space opera that began with Children of Time continues in this extraordinary novel of humanity's battle for survival on a terraformed planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth failed. In a desperate bid to escape, the spaceship Enkidu and its captain, Heorest Holt, carried its precious human cargo to a potential new paradise. Generations later, this fragile colony has managed to survive, eking out a hardy existence. Yet life is tough, and much technological knowledge has been lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then strangers appear. They possess unparalleled knowledge and thrilling technology – and they've arrived from another world to help humanity’s colonies. But not all is as it seems, and the price of the strangers' help may be the colony itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children of Memory by Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning author Adrian Tchaikovsky is a far-reaching space opera spanning generations, species and galaxies.</description>

  <description>Shakespeare's intertwined love polygons begin to get complicated from the start--Demetrius and Lysander both want Hermia but she only has eyes for Lysander. Bad news is, Hermia's father wants Demetrius for a son-in-law. On the outside is Helena, whose unreturned love burns hot for Demetrius. Hermia and Lysander plan to flee from the city under cover of darkness but are pursued by an enraged Demetrius (who is himself pursued by an enraptured Helena). In the forest, unbeknownst to the mortals, Oberon and Titania (King and Queen of the faeries) are having a spat over a servant boy. The plot twists up when Oberon's head mischief-maker, Puck, runs loose with a flower which causes people to fall in love with the first thing they see upon waking. Throw in a group of labourers preparing a play for the Duke's wedding (one of whom is given a donkey's head and Titania for a lover by Puck) and the complications become fantastically funny.</description>

  <description>Prepare for a different kind of singularity in this follow-up to the Hugo-nominated novel Blindsight &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the eve of the twenty-second century: a world where the dearly departed send postcards back from Heaven and evangelicals make scientific breakthroughs by speaking in tongues; where genetically engineered vampires solve problems intractable to baseline humans and soldiers come with zombie switches that shut off self-awareness during combat. And it’s all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology has turned computational, a cat's-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking refuge in the Oregon desert, he’s turned his back on a humanity that shatters into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasn’t yet found the man she's sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes them all to a meeting with something they will only call “The Angels of the Asteroids.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man, face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought itself.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“It’s undeniably thrilling to find words for our strangest feelings…Koenig casts light into lonely corners of human experience…An enchanting book. “ &lt;i&gt;—The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A truly original book in every sense of the word, &lt;i&gt;The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows &lt;/i&gt;poetically defines emotions that we all feel but don’t have the words to express—until now. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever wondered about the lives of each person you pass on the street, realizing that everyone is the main character in their own story, each living a life as vivid and complex as your own? That feeling has a name: “sonder.” Or maybe you’ve watched a thunderstorm roll in and felt a primal hunger for disaster, hoping it would shake up your life. That’s called “lachesism.” Or you were looking through old photos and felt a pang of nostalgia for a time you’ve never actually experienced. That’s “anemoia.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you’ve never heard of these terms before, that’s because they didn’t exist until John Koenig set out to fill the gaps in our language of emotion. &lt;i&gt;The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows &lt;/i&gt;“creates beautiful new words that we need but do not yet have,” says John Green, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars. &lt;/i&gt;By turns poignant, relatable, and mind-bending, the definitions include whimsical etymologies drawn from languages around the world, interspersed with otherworldly collages and lyrical essays that explore forgotten corners of the human condition—from “astrophe,” the longing to explore beyond the planet Earth, to “zenosyne,” the sense that time keeps getting faster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone who enjoys a shift in perspective, pondering the ineffable feelings that make up our lives. With a gorgeous package and beautiful illustrations throughout, this is the perfect gift for creatives, word nerds, and human beings everywhere.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From award-winning author R. F. Kuang comes &lt;i&gt;Babel,&lt;/i&gt; a historical fantasy epic that grapples with student revolutions, colonial resistance, and the use of language and translation as the dominating tool of the British Empire&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traduttore, traditore:&lt;/i&gt; An act of translation is always an act of betrayal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1828&lt;/b&gt;. Robin Swift, orphaned by cholera in Canton, is brought to London by the mysterious Professor Lovell. There, he trains for years in Latin, Ancient Greek, and Chinese, all in preparation for the day he’ll enroll in Oxford University’s prestigious Royal Institute of Translation—also known as Babel. The tower and its students are the world's center for translation and, more importantly, magic. Silver-working—the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation using enchanted silver bars—has made the British unparalleled in power, as the arcane craft serves the Empire's quest for colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Robin, Oxford is a utopia dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. But knowledge obeys power, and as a Chinese boy raised in Britain, Robin realizes serving Babel means betraying his motherland. As his studies progress, Robin finds himself caught between Babel and the shadowy Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to stopping imperial expansion. When Britain pursues an unjust war with China over silver and opium, Robin must decide . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can powerful institutions be changed from within, or does revolution always require violence?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In the valley of Sorrows, a monk is brutally murdered for a worthless manuscript, and the abbot of the humble monastery calls upon Master Li and Number Ten Ox to investigate the seemingly senseless killing. The most likely suspect is the infamous Laughing Prince, founder of the valley, whose murderous frenzies have made him a legend. But even Master Li must concede that the prince has a pretty good alibi: he's been dead for more than seven hundred years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undaunted, Master Li and Number Ten Ox begin their search for the Laughing Prince. Together they roam a mystical countryside populated by demons, ghosts, murderers, and mad kings to the very gates of heaven itself -- and what they find there is even stranger still.</description>

  <description>An antimeme is an idea with self-censoring properties; an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antimemes are real. Think of any piece of information which you wouldn't share with anybody, like passwords, taboos and dirty secrets. Or any piece of information which would be difficult to share even if you tried: complex equations, very boring passages of text, large blocks of random numbers, and dreams...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain something you can't record or remember? How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you're at war?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this is not your first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ebook is an official release by me, qntm from the SCP Foundation wiki! PM me if you require confirmation.</description>

  <description>A #1 New York Times bestseller and arguably the best business narrative ever written, Barbarians at the Gate is the classic account of the fall of RJR Nabisco. An enduring masterpiece of investigative journalism by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, it includes a new afterword by the authors that brings this remarkable story of greed and double-dealings up to date twenty years after the famed deal. The Los Angeles Times calls Barbarians at the Gate, “Superlative.” The Chicago Tribune raves, “It’s hard to imagine a better story...and it’s hard to imagine a better account.” And in an era of spectacular business crashes and federal bailouts, it still stands as a valuable cautionary tale that must be heeded.</description>

  <description>The #1 New York Times–bestselling author of What If? and How To provides his best answers yet to the weirdest questions you never thought to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The millions of people around the world who read and loved What If? still have questions, and those questions are getting stranger. Thank goodness xkcd creator Randall Munroe is here to help. Planning to ride a fire pole from the moon back to Earth? The hardest part is sticking the landing. Hoping to cool the atmosphere by opening everyone’s freezer door at the same time? Maybe it’s time for a brief introduction to thermodynamics. Want to know what would happen if you rode a helicopter blade, built a billion-story building, made a lava lamp out of lava, or jumped on a geyser as it erupted? Okay, if you insist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you go on a cosmic road trip, feed the residents of New York City to a T. rex, or fill every church with bananas, be sure to consult this practical guide for impractical ideas. Unfazed by absurdity, Randall consults the latest research on everything from swing-set physics to airplane-catapult design to clearly and concisely answer his readers’ questions. As he consistently demonstrates, you can learn a lot from examining how the world might work in very specific extreme circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with bonkers science, boundless curiosity, and Randall’s signature stick-figure comics, What If? 2 is sure to be another instant classic adored by inquisitive readers of all ages.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; Editors' Choice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In Daub’s hands the founding concepts of Silicon Valley don’t make money; they fall apart." --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From FSGO x &lt;i&gt;Logic&lt;/i&gt;: a Stanford professor's spirited dismantling of Silicon Valley's intellectual origins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Adrian Daub’s &lt;i&gt;What Tech Calls Thinking&lt;/i&gt; is a lively dismantling of the ideas that form the intellectual bedrock of Silicon Valley. Equally important to Silicon Valley’s world-altering innovation are the language and ideas it uses to explain and justify itself. And often, those fancy new ideas are simply old motifs playing dress-up in a hoodie. From the myth of dropping out to the war cry of “disruption,” Daub locates the Valley’s supposedly original, radical thinking in the ideas of Heidegger and Ayn Rand, the New Age Esalen Foundation in Big Sur, and American traditions from the tent revival to predestination. Written with verve and imagination, &lt;i&gt;What Tech Calls Thinking&lt;/i&gt; is an intellectual refutation of Silicon Valley's ethos, pulling back the curtain on the self-aggrandizing myths the Valley tells about itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FSG Originals × &lt;i&gt;Logic &lt;/i&gt;dissects the way technology functions in everyday lives. The titans of Silicon Valley, for all their utopian imaginings, never really had our best interests at recent threats to democracy, truth, privacy, and safety, as a result of tech’s reckless pursuit of progress, have shown as much. We present an alternate story, one that delights in capturing technology in all its contradictions and innovation, across borders and socioeconomic divisions, from history through the future, beyond platitudes and PR hype, and past doom and gloom. Our collaboration features four brief but provocative forays into the tech industry’s many worlds, and aspires to incite fresh conversations about technology focused on nuanced and accessible explorations of the emerging tools that reorganize and redefine life today.</description>

  <description>The Singularity. It is the era of the posthuman. Artificial intelligences have surpassed the limits of human intellect. Biotechnological beings have rendered people all but extinct. Molecular nanotechnology runs rampant, replicating and reprogramming at will. Contact with extraterrestrial life grows more imminent with each new day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling to survive and thrive in this accelerated world are three generations of the Macx clan: Manfred, an entrepreneur dealing in intelligence amplification technology whose mind is divided between his physical environment and the Internet; his daughter, Amber, on the run from her domineering mother, seeking her fortune in the outer system as an indentured astronaut; and Sirhan, Amber's son, who finds his destiny linked to the fate of all of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something is systemically dismantling the nine planets of the solar system. Something beyond human comprehension. Something that has no use for biological life in any form.</description>

  <description>When the planet of New Moscow was brutally destroyed, its few survivors launched a counter-attack against the most likely culprit - the neighbouring system of trade rival New Dresden. But New Dresden wasn't responsible, and as the deadly missiles approach their target, Rachel Mansour is assigned to find out who was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one person who does know is a disaffected teenager who calls herself Wednesday Shadowmist. But Wednesday has no idea where she might be hiding this significant information. Time is limited and if Rachel can't resolve this mystery it will mean annihilation of an entire world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In the twenty-first century man created the Eschaton, a sentient artificial intelligence. It pushed Earth through the greatest technological evolution ever known, while warning that time travel is forbidden, and transgressors will be eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distant descendants of this ultra high-tech Earth live in parochial simplicity on the far-flung worlds of the New Republic. Their way of life is threatened by the arrival of an alien information plague known as the Festival. As forbidden technologies are literally dropped from the sky, suppressed political factions descend into revolutionary turmoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A battle fleet is sent from Earth to destroy the Festival, but Spaceship engineer Martin Springfield and U.N. diplomat Rachel Mansour have been assigned rather different tasks. Their orders are to diffuse the crisis or to sabotage the New Republic's war-fleet, whatever the cost, before the Eschaton takes hostile action on a galactic scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When We Cease to Understand the World is a book about the complicated links between scientific and mathematical discovery, madness, and destruction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fritz Haber, Alexander Grothendieck, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger—these are some of luminaries into whose troubled lives Benjamín Labatut thrusts the reader, showing us how they grappled with the most profound questions of existence. They have strokes of unparalleled genius, alienate friends and lovers, descend into isolation and insanity. Some of their discoveries reshape human life for the better; others pave the way to chaos and unimaginable suffering. The lines are never clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a breakneck pace and with a wealth of disturbing detail, Labatut uses the imaginative resources of fiction to tell the stories of the scientists and mathematicians who expanded our notions of the possible.</description>

  <description>Written for anyone who wants to grow at work—from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company—Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony’s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor. Tony uses examples that are instantly captivating, like the process of building the very first iPod and iPhone. Every chapter is designed to help readers with a problem they’re facing right now—how to get funding for their startup, whether to quit their job or not, or just how to deal with the jerk in the next cubicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony forged his path to success alongside mentors like Steve Jobs and Bill Campbell, icons of Silicon Valley who succeeded time and time again. But Tony doesn’t follow the Silicon Valley credo that you have to reinvent everything from scratch to make something great. His advice is unorthodox because it’s old school. Because Tony’s learned that human nature doesn’t change. You don’t have to reinvent how you lead and manage—just what you make.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, &lt;i&gt;The Way of Kings&lt;/i&gt;, book one of The Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Speak again the ancient oaths:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life before death.&lt;br /&gt;Strength before weakness.&lt;br /&gt;Journey before Destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and return to men the Shards they once bore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Knights Radiant must stand again.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A globe-trotting quest to find blue in the natural world—and to understand our collective obsession with this bewitching color&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Blue is a rare color—natural blue, that is. From morpho butterflies in the rain forest to the blue jay flitting past your window, vanishingly few living things are blue—and most that &lt;i&gt;appear &lt;/i&gt;so are doing sleight of hand with physics or complex chemistry. Flowers modify the red pigment anthocyanin to achieve their blue hue. Even the blue sky above us is a trick of the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yet this hard-to-spot accent color in our surroundings looms large in our affections. Science journalist Kai Kupferschmidt has been fascinated by blue since childhood. His quest to find and understand his favorite color and its hallowed place in our culture takes him to a gene-splicing laboratory in Japan, a volcanic lake in Oregon, and to Brandenburg, Germany—home of the last Spix’s macaws. From deep underground where blue minerals grow into crystals to miles away in space where satellites gaze down at our “blue marble” planet, wherever we &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;find blue, it always has a story to tell.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Out in the darkness of space, something is targeting the Greatships.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their vast cargo holds and a crew that could fill a city, the Greatships are the lifeblood of human-occupied space, transporting an unimaginable volume - and value - of goods from City, the greatest human orbital, all the way to Tradepoint at the other, to trade for xenoglas with an unknowable alien species. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has always been Marca Nbaro's dream to achieve the near-impossible: escape her upbringing and venture into space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it took, to make her way onto the crew of the Greatship &lt;i&gt;Athens&lt;/i&gt;, was thousands of hours in simulators, dedication and pawning or selling every scrap of her old life in order to forge a new one. But though she's made her way onboard with faked papers, leaving her old life - and scandals - behind isn't so easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She may have just combined all the dangers of her former life, with all the perils of the new...</description>

  <description>Most of us give little thought to the back of the book—it’s just where you go to look things up. But here is the secret world of the index: an unsung but extraordinary everyday tool, with an illustrious but little-known history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charting its curious path from the monasteries and universities of thirteenth-century Europe to Silicon Valley in the twenty-first, Dennis Duncan reveals how the index has saved heretics from the stake, kept politicians from high office, and made us all into the readers we are today. We follow it through German print shops and Enlightenment coffee houses, novelists’ living rooms and university laboratories, encountering emperors and popes, philosophers and prime ministers, poets, librarians, and—of course—indexers along the way. Duncan reveals the vast role of the index in our evolving literary and intellectual culture, and he shows that in the Age of Search we are all &lt;em&gt;index-rakers&lt;/em&gt; at heart.</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, Zelda led a band of merry adventurers whose knacks let them travel to alternate realities and battle the black rot that threatened to unmake each world. Zelda was the warrior; Ish could locate people anywhere; Ramon always knew what path to take; Sarah could turn catastrophe aside. Keeping them all connected: Sal, Zelda’s lover and the group's heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until their final, failed mission, when Sal was lost. When they all fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years on, Ish, Ramon, and Sarah are happy and successful. Zelda is alone, always traveling, destroying rot throughout the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it boils through the crack in the Liberty Bell, the rot gives Zelda proof that Sal is alive, trapped somewhere in the alts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zelda’s getting the band back together—plus Sal’s young cousin June, who has a knack none of them have ever seen before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As relationships rekindle, the friends begin to believe they can find Sal and heal all the worlds. It’s not going to be easy, but they’ve faced worse before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things have changed, out there in the alts. And in everyone's hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh from winning the Hugo and Nebula Awards, Max Gladstone weaves elements of American myth--the muscle car, the open road, the white-hatted cowboy--into a deeply emotional tale where his characters must find their own truths if they are to survive.</description>

  <description>Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A tongue-in-cheek introduction to the science of comic-book supervillainy, revealing the true potential of today's most advanced technologies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Taking over the world is a lot of work. Any supervillain is bound to have questions: What's the perfect location for a floating secret base? What zany heist will fund my immoral plans? How do I control the weather, destroy the internet, and never, ever die?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;How to Take Over the World&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author and award-winning comics writer Ryan North details a number of outlandish villainous schemes, drawing on known science and real-world technologies. Picking up where &lt;i&gt;How to Invent Everything &lt;/i&gt;left off, his explanations are as fun and informative as they are completely absurd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he instructs readers on how to take over the world, North also reveals how we can save it. This sly guide to some of the greatest challenges and existential threats facing humanity accessibly explores ways to mitigate climate change, improve human life spans, prevent cyberterrorism, and finally make Jurassic Park a reality.</description>

  <description>One of the world's most celebrated scholars, Stephen Greenblatt has crafted both an innovative work of history and a thrilling story of discovery, in which one manuscript, plucked from a thousand years of neglect, changed the course of human thought and made possible the world as we know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly six hundred years ago, a short, genial, cannily alert man in his late thirties took a very old manuscript off a library shelf, saw with excitement what he had discovered, and ordered that it be copied. That book was the last surviving manuscript of an ancient Roman philosophical epic, &lt;em&gt;On the Nature of Things&lt;/em&gt;, by Lucretius—a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functioned without the aid of gods, that religious fear was damaging to human life, and that matter was made up of very small particles in eternal motion, colliding and swerving in new directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The copying and translation of this ancient book—the greatest discovery of the greatest book-hunter of his age—fueled the Renaissance, inspiring artists such as Botticelli and thinkers such as Giordano Bruno; shaped the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson.</description>

  <description>Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics.</description>

  <description>The astonishing sequel to Children of Time, the award-winning novel of humanity's battle for survival on a terraformed planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long ago, Earth's terraforming program sent ships out to build new homes for humanity among the stars and made an unexpected discovery: a planet with life. But the scientists were unaware that the alien ecosystem was more developed than the primitive life forms originally discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, thousands of years later, the Portiids and their humans have sent an exploration vessel following fragmentary radio signals. They discover a system in crisis, warring factions trying to recover from an apocalyptic catastrophe arising from what the early terraformers awoke all those years before.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A literary descendent of Ursula K. Le Guin, Ruthanna Emrys crafts a novel of extra-terrestrial diplomacy and urgent climate repair bursting with quiet, tenuous hope and an underlying warmth.&lt;i&gt; A Half-Built Garden&lt;/i&gt; depicts a world worth building towards, a humanity worth saving from itself, and an alien community worth entering with open arms. It's not the easiest future to build, but it's one that just might be in reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On a warm March night in 2083, Judy Wallach-Stevens wakes to a warning of unknown pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay. She heads out to check what she expects to be a false alarm—and stumbles upon the first alien visitors to Earth. These aliens have crossed the galaxy to save humanity, convinced that the people of Earth must leave their ecologically-ravaged planet behind and join them among the stars. And if humanity doesn't agree, they may need to be saved by force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the watershed networks that rose up to save the planet from corporate devastation aren't ready to give up on Earth. Decades ago, they reorganized humanity around the hope of keeping the world livable. By sharing the burden of decision-making, they've started to heal our wounded planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now corporations, nation-states, and networks all vie to represent humanity to these powerful new beings, and if anyone accepts the aliens' offer, Earth may be lost. With everyone’s eyes turned skyward, the future hinges on Judy's effort to create understanding, both within and beyond her own species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</description>

  <description>Throughout his career, Eduardo Galeano has turned our understanding of history and reality on its head. Isabelle Allende said his works “invade the reader’s mind, to persuade him or her to surrender to the charm of his writing and power of his idealism.”&lt;i&gt;Mirrors&lt;/i&gt;, Galeano’s most ambitious project since &lt;i&gt;Memory of Fire&lt;/i&gt;, is an unofficial history of the world seen through history’s unseen, unheard, and forgotten. As Galeano notes: “Official history has it that Vasco Núñez de Balboa was the first man to see, from a summit in Panama, the two oceans at once. Were the people who lived there blind??”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recalling the lives of artists, writers, gods, and visionaries, from the Garden of Eden to twenty-first-century New York, of the black slaves who built the White House and the women erased by men’s fears, and told in hundreds of kaleidoscopic vignettes, &lt;i&gt;Mirrors&lt;/i&gt; is a magic mosaic of our humanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A powerful examination of what we think we know about the brain and why -- despite technological advances -- the workings of our most essential organ remain a mystery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;For thousands of years, thinkers and scientists have tried to understand what the brain does. Yet, despite the astonishing discoveries of science, we still have only the vaguest idea of how the brain works. In &lt;i&gt;The Idea of the Brain&lt;/i&gt;, scientist and historian Matthew Cobb traces how our conception of the brain has evolved over the centuries. Although it might seem to be a story of ever-increasing knowledge of biology, Cobb shows how our ideas about the brain have been shaped by each era's most significant technologies. Today we might think the brain is like a supercomputer. In the past, it has been compared to a telegraph, a telephone exchange, or some kind of hydraulic system. What will we think the brain is like tomorrow, when new technology arises? The result is an essential read for anyone interested in the complex processes that drive science and the forces that have shaped our marvelous brains.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A captivating book about the emotional and literary power of the lives we might have lived had our chances or choices been different.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We each live one life, formed by paths taken and untaken. Choosing a job, getting married, deciding on a place to live or whether to have children--every decision precludes another. But what if you'd gone the other way? It can be a seductive thought, even a haunting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew H. Miller illuminates this theme of modern culture: the allure of the alternate self. From Robert Frost to Sharon Olds, Virginia Woolf to Ian McEwan, Jane Hirshfield to Carl Dennis, storytellers of every stripe write of the lives we didn't have. What forces encourage us to think this way about ourselves, and to identify with fictional and poetic voices speaking from the shadows of what might have been? Not only poets and novelists, but psychologists and philosophers have much to say on this question. Miller finds wisdom in all these sources, revealing the beauty, the power, and the struggle of our unled lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an elegant and provocative rumination, he lingers with other selves, listening to what they say. Peering down the path not taken can be frightening, but it has its rewards. &lt;i&gt;On Not Being Someone Else&lt;/i&gt; offers the balm that when we confront our imaginary selves, we discover who we are.</description>

  <description>Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does he?</description>

  <description>A race for survival among the stars... Humanity's last survivors escaped earth's ruins to find a new home. But when they find it, can their desperation overcome its dangers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHO WILL INHERIT THIS NEW EARTH?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last remnants of the human race left a dying Earth, desperate to find a new home among the stars. Following in the footsteps of their ancestors, they discover the greatest treasure of the past age—a world terraformed and prepared for human life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries of what they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the true heirs of this new Earth?</description>

  <description>Stories mould who we are, from our character to our cultural identity. They drive us to act out our dreams and ambitions, and shape our politics and beliefs. We use them to construct our relationships, to keep order in our law courts, to interpret events in our newspapers and social media. Storytelling is an essential part of what makes us human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been many attempts to understand what makes a good story – from Joseph Campbell’s well-worn theories about myth and archetype to recent attempts to crack the ‘Bestseller Code’. But few have used a scientific approach. This is curious, for if we are to truly understand storytelling in its grandest sense, we must first come to understand the ultimate storyteller – the human brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this scalpel-sharp, thought-provoking book, Will Storr demonstrates how master storytellers manipulate and compel us, leading us on a journey from the Hebrew scriptures to Mr Men, from Booker Prize-winning literature to box set TV. Applying dazzling psychological research and cutting-edge neuroscience to the foundations of our myths and archetypes, he shows how we can use these tools to tell better stories – and make sense of our chaotic modern world.</description>

  <description>A virtuoso novel where logic confronts magic and that explores the part of ourselves that eludes us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June 2021, a senseless event upends the lives of hundreds of men and women, all passengers on a flight from Paris to New York. Among them: Blake, a respectable family man, though he works as a contract killer; Slimboy, a Nigerian pop star tired of living a lie; Joanna, a formidable lawyer whose flaws have caught up with her; and Victor Miesel, a critically acclaimed yet commercially unsuccessful writer who suddenly becomes a cult hit. All of them believed they had double lives. None imagined just how true that was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This witty variation on the doppelgänger theme, which takes us on a journey from Lagos and Mumbai to the White House, is Hervé Le Tellier's most ambitious work yet.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gorgeously illustrated deep dive into the immune system that will forever change how you think about your body, from the creator of the popular science YouTube channel Kurzgesagt—In a Nutshell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wake up and feel a tickle in your throat. Your head hurts. You're mildly annoyed as you get the kids ready for school and dress for work yourself. Meanwhile, an epic war is being fought, just below your skin. Millions are fighting and dying for you to be able to complain as you head out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what, exactly, &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; your immune system?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second only to the human brain in its complexity, it is one of the oldest and most critical facets of life on Earth. Without it, you would die within days. In &lt;i&gt;Immune&lt;/i&gt;, Philipp Dettmer, the brains behind the most popular science channel on YouTube, takes readers on a journey through the fortress of the human body and its defenses. There is a constant battle of staggering scale raging within us, full of stories of invasion, strategy, defeat, and noble self-sacrifice. In fact, in the time you've been reading this, your immune system has probably identified and eradicated a cancer cell that started to grow in your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chapter delves into an element of the immune system, including defenses like antibodies and inflammation as well as threats like bacteria, allergies, and cancer, as Dettmer reveals why boosting your immune system is actually nonsense, how parasites sneak their way past your body's defenses, how viruses work, and what goes on in your wounds when you cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlivened by engaging graphics and immersive descriptions, &lt;i&gt;Immune&lt;/i&gt; turns one of the most intricate, interconnected, and confusing subjects—immunology—into a gripping adventure through an astonishing alien landscape. &lt;i&gt;Immune&lt;/i&gt; is a vital and remarkably fun crash course in what is arguably, and increasingly, the most important system in the body.</description>

  <description>From the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Power Broker and The Years of Lyndon Johnson: an unprecedented gathering of vivid, candid, deeply revealing recollections about his experiences researching and writing his acclaimed books&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in his long career, Robert Caro gives us a glimpse into his own life and work in these evocatively written, personal pieces. He describes what it was like to interview the mighty Robert Moses; what it felt like to begin discovering the extent of the political power Moses wielded; the combination of discouragement and exhilaration he felt confronting the vast holdings of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum in Austin, Texas; his encounters with witnesses, including longtime residents wrenchingly displaced by the construction of Moses’ Cross-Bronx Expressway and Lady Bird Johnson acknowledging the beauty and influence of one of LBJ’s mistresses. He gratefully remembers how, after years of loneliness, he found a writers’ community at the New York Public Library’s Frederick Lewis Allen Room and details the ways he goes about planning and composing his books.&lt;br /&gt; Caro recalls the moments at which he came to understand that he wanted to write not just about the men who wielded power but about the people and the politics that were shaped by that power. And he talks about the importance to him of the writing itself, of how he tries to infuse it with a sense of place and mood to bring characters and situations to life on the page. Taken together, these reminiscences–some previously published, some written expressly for this book–bring into focus the passion, the wry self-deprecation, and the integrity with which this brilliant historian has always approached his work.</description>

  <description>"Stafford Beer is undoubtedly among the world's most provocative, creative, and profound thinkers on the subject of management, and he records his thinking with a flair that is unmatched. His writing is as much art as it is science. He is the most viable system I know." Dr Russell L Ackoff, The Institute for Interactive Management, Pennsylvania, USA. "If . anyone can make it [Operations Research] understandably readable and positively interesting it is Stafford Beer . everyone in management . should be grateful to him for using clear and at times elegant English and . even elegant diagrams." The Economist This is the second edition of a book which has already become a management 'standard' both in universities and on the bookshelves of managers and their advisers. Brain of the Firm develops an account of the firm based upon insights derived from the study of the human nervous system, and is a basic text from the author's theory of viable systems. Despite the neurophysiology, the book is written for managers to understand. The companion volume to this book is The Heart of Enterprise, which is intended to support and complement this text. "Stafford Beer's works represent required reading for everyone who believes that a capacity for rigorous thinking is an essential attribute of today's successful managers and administrators. Brain of the Firm shows a first-rate intellect at work and provides concepts, models and inspiration for both practitioners and teachers." Sir Douglas Hague, CBE</description>

  <description>As only he can, Aldous Huxley explores the mind's remote frontiers and the unmapped areas of human consciousness. These two astounding essays are among the most profound studies of the effects of mind-expanding drugs written in this century. Contains the complete texts of &lt;i&gt;

  <description>The New York Times bestseller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A warm and loving reflection that, like good bourbon, will stand the test of time.” —Eric Asimov, The New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of how Julian Van Winkle III, the caretaker of the most coveted cult Kentucky Bourbon whiskey in the world, fought to protect his family's heritage and preserve the taste of his forebears, in a world where authenticity, like his product, is in very short supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following his father’s death decades ago, Julian Van Winkle stepped in to try to save the bourbon business his grandfather had founded on the mission “We make fine bourbon—at a profit if we can, at a loss if we must, but always fine bourbon.” With the company in its wilderness years, Julian committed to safeguarding his namesake’s legacy or going down with the ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he discovered that hundreds of barrels from the family distillery had survived their sale to a multinational conglomerate. The whiskey that Julian produced after recovering those barrels would immediately be hailed as the greatest in the world—and soon would be the hardest to find. Once they had been used up, a fresh challenge preserving the taste of Pappy in a new age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wright Thompson was invited to ride along as Julian undertook the task. From the Van Winkle family, Wright learned not only about great bourbon but about complicated legacies and the rewards of honoring your people and your craft—lessons that he couldn’t help but apply to his own work and life. May we all be lucky enough to find some of ourselves, as Wright Thompson did, in Pappyland .</description>

  <description>From the former news policy lead at Google, an “informative and often harrowing wake-up call” ( Publishers Weekly ) that explains the high-stakes global cyberwar brewing between Western democracies and the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia that could potentially crush democracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 2016 to 2020, Jacob Helberg led Google’s global internal product policy efforts to combat disinformation and foreign interference. During this time, he found himself in the midst of what can only be described as a quickly escalating two-front technology cold war between democracy and autocracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the front-end, we’re fighting to control the software—applications, news information, social media platforms, and more—of what we see on the screens of our computers, tablets, and phones, a clash which started out primarily with Russia but now increasingly includes China and Iran. Even more ominously, we’re also engaged in a hidden back-end battle—largely with China—to control the internet’s hardware, which includes devices like cellular phones, satellites, fiber-optic cables, and 5G networks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tech-fueled war will shape the world’s balance of power for the coming century as autocracies exploit 21st-century methods to redivide the world into 20th-century-style spheres of influence. Without a firm partnership with the government, Silicon Valley is unable to protect democracy from the autocrats looking to sabotage it from Beijing to Moscow and Tehran. Helberg offers “unnervingly convincing evidence that time is running out in the ‘gray war’ with the enemies of freedom” ( Kirkus Reviews ) which could affect every meaningful aspect of our lives, including our economy, our infrastructure, our national security, and ultimately, our national sovereignty.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Passage of Power&lt;/i&gt; follows Lyndon Johnson through both the most frustrating and the most triumphant periods of his career—1958 to1964. It is a time that would see him trade the extraordinary power he had created for himself as Senate Majority Leader for what became the wretched powerlessness of a Vice President in an administration that disdained and distrusted him. Yet it was, as well, the time in which the presidency, the goal he had always pursued, would be thrust upon him in the moment it took an assassin’s bullet to reach its mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1958, as Johnson began to maneuver for the presidency, he was known as one of the most brilliant politicians of his time, the greatest Senate Leader in our history. But the 1960 nomination would go to the young senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy. Caro gives us an unparalleled account of the machinations behind both the nomination and Kennedy’s decision to offer Johnson the vice presidency, revealing the extent of Robert Kennedy’s efforts to force Johnson off the ticket. With the consummate skill of a master storyteller, he exposes the savage animosity between Johnson and Kennedy’s younger brother, portraying one of America’s great political feuds. Yet Robert Kennedy’s overt contempt for Johnson was only part of the burden of humiliation and isolation he bore as Vice President. With a singular understanding of Johnson’s heart and mind, Caro describes what it was like for this mighty politician to find himself altogether powerless in a world in which power is the crucial commodity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, in Caro’s breathtakingly vivid narrative, we see the Kennedy assassination through Lyndon Johnson’s eyes. We watch Johnson step into the presidency, inheriting a staff fiercely loyal to his slain predecessor; a Congress determined to retain its power over the executive branch; and a nation in shock and mourning. We see how within weeks—grasping the reins of the presidency with supreme mastery—he propels through Congress essential legislation that at the time of Kennedy’s death seemed hopelessly logjammed and seizes on a dormant Kennedy program to create the revolutionary War on Poverty. Caro makes clear how the political genius with which Johnson had ruled the Senate now enabled him to make the presidency wholly his own. This was without doubt Johnson’s finest hour, before his aspirations and accomplishments were overshadowed and eroded by the trap of Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its exploration of this pivotal period in Johnson’s life—and in the life of the nation—&lt;i&gt;The Passage of Power &lt;/i&gt;is not only the story of how he surmounted unprecedented obstacles in order to fulfill the highest purpose of the presidency but is, as well, a revelation of both the pragmatic potential in the presidency and what can be accomplished when the chief executive has the vision and determination to move beyond the pragmatic and initiate programs designed to transform a nation.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;This is the history of temperance and prohibition as you've never read it before: redefining temperance as a progressive, global, pro-justice movement that affected virtually every significant world leader from the eighteenth through early twentieth centuries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When most people think of the prohibition era, they think of speakeasies, gin runners, and backwoods fundamentalists railing about the ills of strong drink. In other words, in the popular imagination, it is a peculiarly American event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, as Mark Lawrence Schrad shows in &lt;i&gt;Smashing the Liquor Machine&lt;/i&gt;, the conventional scholarship on prohibition is extremely misleading for a simple reason: American prohibition was just one piece of a global wave of prohibition laws that occurred around the same time. Schrad's counterintuitive global history of prohibition looks at the anti-alcohol movement around the globe through the experiences of pro-temperance leaders like Thomas Masaryk, founder of Czechoslovakia, Vladimir Lenin, Leo Tolstoy, and anti-colonial activists in India. Schrad argues that temperance wasn't "American exceptionalism" at all, but rather one of the most broad-based and successful transnational social movements of the modern era. In fact, Schrad offers a fundamental re-appraisal of this colorful era to reveal that temperance forces frequently aligned with progressivism, social justice, liberal self-determination, democratic socialism, labor rights, women's rights, and indigenous rights. By placing the temperance movement in a deep global context, he forces us to fundamentally rethink all that we think we know about the movement. Rather than a motley collection of puritanical American evangelicals, the global temperance movement advocated communal self-protection against the corrupt and predatory "liquor machine" that had become exceedingly rich off the misery and addictions of the poor around the world, from the slums of South Asia to central Europe to the Indian reservations of the American west.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many traditional "dry" histories, Smashing the Liquor Machine gives voice to minority and subaltern figures who resisted the global liquor industry, and further highlights that the impulses that led to the temperance movement were far more progressive and variegated than American readers have been led to believe.</description>

  <description>Austerlitz, Wagram, Borodino, Trafalgar, Leipzig, Waterloo: these are the places most closely associated with the Napoleonic Wars. But how did this period of nearly continuous warfare affect the world beyond Europe? The immensity of the fighting waged by France against England, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, and the immediate consequences of the tremors that spread from France as a result, overshadow the profound repercussions that the Napoleonic Wars had throughout the world. In this far-ranging work, Alexander Mikaberidze argues that the Napoleonic Wars can only be fully understood with an international context in mind. France struggled for dominance not only on the plains of Europe but also in the Americas, West and South Africa, Ottoman Empire, Iran, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Taking specific regions in turn, Mikaberidze discusses major political-military events around the world and situates geopolitical decision-making within its long- and short-term contexts. From the British expeditions to Argentina and South Africa to the Franco-Russian maneuvering in the Ottoman Empire, the effects of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars would shape international affairs well into the next century. In Egypt, the Wars led to the rise of Mehmed Ali and the emergence of a powerful Egyptian state; in North America, the period transformed and enlarged the newly established United States; and in South America, the Spanish colonial empire witnessed the start of national-liberation movements that ultimately ended imperial control. Skillfully narrated and deeply researched, here at last is the complete global story of the period, one that expands our contemporary view of the Napoleonic Wars and their role in laying the foundations of the modern world.</description>

  <description>Master of the Senate, Book Three of The Years of Lyndon Johnson, carries Johnson’s story through one of its most remarkable periods: his twelve years, from 1949 to 1960, in the United States Senate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the book is its unprecedented revelation of how legislative power works in America, how the Senate works, and how Johnson, in his ascent to the presidency, mastered the Senate as no political leader before him had ever done.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was during these years that all Johnson’s experience—from his Texas Hill Country boyhood to his passionate representation in Congress of his hardscrabble constituents to his tireless construction of a political machine—came to fruition. Caro introduces the story with a dramatic account of the Senate itself: how Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun had made it the center of governmental energy, the forum in which the great issues of the country were thrashed out. And how, by the time Johnson arrived, it had dwindled into a body that merely responded to executive initiatives, all but impervious to the forces of change. Caro anatomizes the genius for political strategy and tactics by which, in an institution that had made the seniority system all-powerful for a century and more, Johnson became Majority Leader after only a single term-the youngest and greatest Senate Leader in our history; how he manipulated the Senate’s hallowed rules and customs and the weaknesses and strengths of his colleagues to change the “unchangeable” Senate from a loose confederation of sovereign senators to a whirring legislative machine under his own iron-fisted control.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caro demonstrates how Johnson’s political genius enabled him to reconcile the unreconcilable: to retain the support of the southerners who controlled the Senate while earning the trust—or at least the cooperation—of the liberals, led by Paul Douglas and Hubert Humphrey, without whom he could not achieve his goal of winning the presidency. He shows the dark side of Johnson’s ambition: how he proved his loyalty to the great oil barons who had financed his rise to power by ruthlessly destroying the career of the New Dealer who was in charge of regulating them, Federal Power Commission Chairman Leland Olds. And we watch him achieve the impossible: convincing southerners that although he was firmly in their camp as the anointed successor to their leader, Richard Russell, it was essential that they allow him to make some progress toward civil rights. In a breathtaking tour de force, Caro details Johnson’s amazing triumph in maneuvering to passage the first civil rights legislation since 1875.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Master of the Senate, told with an abundance of rich detail that could only have come from Caro’s peerless research, is both a galvanizing portrait of the man himself—the titan of Capital Hill, volcanic, mesmerizing—and a definitive and revelatory study of the workings and personal and legislative power.</description>

  <description>In Means of Ascent, Book Two of The Years of Lyndon Johnson, Robert A. Caro brings alive Lyndon Johnson in his wilderness years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, Johnson’s almost mythic personality—part genius, part behemoth, at once hotly emotional and icily calculating—is seen at its most nakedly ambitious. This multifaceted book carries the President-to-be from the aftermath of his devastating defeat in his 1941 campaign for the Senate-the despair it engendered in him, and the grueling test of his spirit that followed as political doors slammed shut-through his service in World War II (and his artful embellishment of his record) to the foundation of his fortune (and the actual facts behind the myth he created about it).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The culminating drama—the explosive heart of the book—is Caro’s illumination, based on extraordinarily detailed investigation, of one of the great political mysteries of the century. Having immersed himself in Johnson’s life and world, Caro is able to reveal the true story of the fiercely contested 1948 senatorial election, for years shrouded in rumor, which Johnson was not believed capable of winning, which he “had to” win or face certain political death, and which he did win-by 87 votes, the “87 votes that changed history.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Telling that epic story “in riveting and eye-opening detail,” Caro returns to the American consciousness a magnificent lost hero. He focuses closely not only on Johnson, whom we see harnessing every last particle of his strategic brilliance and energy, but on Johnson’s “unbeatable” opponent, the beloved former Texas Governor Coke Stevenson, who embodied in his own life the myth of the cowboy knight and was himself a legend for his unfaltering integrity. And ultimately, as the political duel between the two men quickens—carrying with it all the confrontational and moral drama of the perfect Western—Caro makes us witness to a momentous turning point in American the tragic last stand of the old politics versus the new—the politics of issue versus the politics of image, mass manipulation, money and electronic dazzle.</description>

  <description>The Years of Lyndon Johnson is the political biography of our time. No president—no era of American politics—has been so intensively and sharply examined at a time when so many prime witnesses to hitherto untold or misinterpreted facets of a life, a career, and a period of history could still be persuaded to speak.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Path to Power, Book One, reveals in extraordinary detail the genesis of the almost superhuman drive, energy, and urge to power that set LBJ apart. Chronicling the startling early emergence of Johnson’s political genius, it follows him from his Texas boyhood through the years of the Depression in the Texas hill Country to the triumph of his congressional debut in New Deal Washington, to his heartbreaking defeat in his first race for the Senate, and his attainment, nonetheless, of the national power for which he hungered.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We see in him, from earliest childhood, a fierce, unquenchable necessity to be first, to win, to dominate—coupled with a limitless capacity for hard, unceasing labor in the service of his own ambition. Caro shows us the big, gangling, awkward young Lyndon—raised in one of the country’s most desperately poor and isolated areas, his education mediocre at best, his pride stung by his father’s slide into failure and financial ruin—lunging for success, moving inexorably toward that ultimate “impossible” goal that he sets for himself years before any friend or enemy suspects what it may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We watch him, while still at college, instinctively (and ruthlessly) creating the beginnings of the political machine that was to serve him for three decades. We see him employing his extraordinary ability to mesmerize and manipulate powerful older men, to mesmerize (and sometimes almost enslave) useful subordinates. We see him carrying out, before his thirtieth year, his first great political inspiration: tapping-and becoming the political conduit for-the money and influence of the new oil men and contractors who were to grow with him to immense power. We follow, close up, the radical fluctuations of his relationships with the formidable “Mr. Sam” Rayburn (who loved him like a son and whom he betrayed) and with FDR himself. And we follow the dramas of his emotional life-the intensities and complications of his relationships with his family, his contemporaries, his girls; his wooing and winning of the shy Lady Bird; his secret love affair, over many years, with the mistress of one of his most ardent and generous supporters . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Johnson driving his people to the point of exhausted tears, equally merciless with himself . . . Johnson bullying, cajoling, lying, yet inspiring an amazing loyalty . . . Johnson maneuvering to dethrone the unassailable old Jack Garner (then Vice President of the United States) as the New Deal’s “connection” in Texas, and seize the power himself . . . Johnson raging . . . Johnson hugging . . . Johnson bringing light and, indeed, life to the worn Hill Country farmers and their old-at-thirty wives via the district’s first electric lines.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We see him at once unscrupulous, admirable, treacherous, devoted. And we see the country that bred him: the harshness and “nauseating loneliness” of the rural life; the tragic panorama of the Depression; the sudden glow of hope at the dawn of the Age of Roosevelt. And always, in the foreground, on the move, LBJ.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here is Lyndon Johnson—his Texas, his Washington, his America—in a book that brings us as close as we have ever been to a true perception of political genius and the American political process.</description>

  <description>One of the best-loved of Nabokov’s novels, &lt;i&gt;Pnin&lt;/i&gt; features his funniest and most heart-rending character. Professor Timofey Pnin is a haplessly disoriented Russian émigré precariously employed on an American college campus in the 1950's. Pnin struggles to maintain his dignity through a series of comic and sad misunderstandings, all the while falling victim both to subtle academic conspiracies and to the manipulations of a deliberately unreliable narrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially an almost grotesquely comic figure, Pnin gradually grows in stature by contrast with those who laugh at him. Whether taking the wrong train to deliver a lecture in a language he has not mastered or throwing a faculty party during which he learns he is losing his job, the gently preposterous hero of this enchanting novel evokes the reader’s deepest protective instinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serialized in &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; and published in book form in 1957, &lt;i&gt;Pnin&lt;/i&gt; brought Nabokov both his first National Book Award nomination and hitherto unprecedented popularity.</description>

  <description>When a shattered kayak and camping gear are found on an uninhabited island in the Pacific Northwest, they reignite a mystery surrounding a shocking act of protest. Five months earlier, logger-turned-activist Grant Hadwin had plunged naked into a river in British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands, towing a chainsaw. When his night's work was done, a unique Sitka spruce, 165 feet tall and covered with luminous golden needles, teetered on its stump. Two days later it fell.&lt;br /&gt;As vividly as John Krakauer puts readers on Everest, John Vaillant takes us into the heart of North America's last great forest.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this urgent, authoritative book, Bill Gates sets out a wide-ranging, practical - and accessible - plan for how the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions in time to avoid a climate catastrophe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Gates has spent a decade investigating the causes and effects of climate change. With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet's slide toward certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions-suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.</description>

      <![CDATA[Very lucid (like Melinda Gates’ writing - clearly a smart couple!) and good perspective on the relative impacts of different areas and interventions. Not a lot I hadn’t encountered before, but a very solid summary. I was a little disappointed at the minimal discussion of geoengineering- I get why given the audience/goals if the book, but saying “it can’t/won’t happen without international agreement” doesn’t hold up.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A spare and gripping novel about the next pandemic--completed by the award-winning Jim Shepard before COVID-19 even emerged--that reads like a fictional sequel to our current crisis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a tiny settlement on the west coast of Greenland, 11-year-old Aleq and his best friend, frequent trespassers at a mining site exposed to mountains of long-buried and thawing permafrost, carry what they pick up back into their village, and from there Shepard's harrowing and deeply moving story follows Aleq, one of the few survivors of the initial outbreak, through his identification and radical isolation as the likely index patient. While he shoulders both a crushing guilt for what he may have done and the hopes of a world looking for answers, we also meet two Epidemic Intelligence Service investigators dispatched from the CDC--Jeannine, an epidemiologist and daughter of Algerian immigrants, and Danice, an M.D. and lab wonk. As they attempt to head off the cataclysm, Jeannine--moving from the Greenland hospital overwhelmed with the first patients to a Level 4 high-security facility in the Rocky Mountains--does what she can to sustain Aleq. Both a chamber piece of multiple intimate perspectives and a more omniscient glimpse into the megastructures (political, cultural, and biological) that inform such a disaster, the novel reminds us of the crucial bonds that form in the midst of catastrophe, as a child and several hypereducated adults learn what it means to provide adequate support for those they love. In the process, they celebrate the precious worlds they might lose, and help to shape others that may survive.</description>

  <description>Competitive advantage. The value chain. Five forces. Industry structure. Differentiation. Relative cost. If you want to understand how companies achieve and sustain competitive success, Michael Porter's frameworks are the foundation. But while everyone in business may know Porter's name, many managers misunderstand and misuse his concepts. &lt;br /&gt;Understanding Michael Porter sets the record straight, providing the first concise, accessible summary of Porter's revolutionary thinking. Written with Porter's full cooperation by Joan Magretta, his former editor at Harvard Business Review, this new book delivers fresh, clear examples to illustrate and update Porter's ideas. &lt;br /&gt;Magretta uses her wide business experience to translate Porter's powerful insights into practice and to correct the most common misconceptions about them--for instance, that competition is about being unique, not being the best; that it is a contest over profits, not a battle between rivals; that strategy is about choosing to make some customers unhappy, not being all things to all customers. &lt;br /&gt;An added feature is an original Q&amp;amp;A with Porter himself, which includes answers to managers' FAQs. &lt;br /&gt;Eminently readable, this book will enable every manager in your organization to grasp Porter's ideas--and swiftly deploy them to drive your company's success.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Most Human Human&lt;/i&gt; is a provocative, exuberant, and profound exploration of the ways in which computers are reshaping our ideas of what it means to be human. Its starting point is the annual Turing Test, which pits artificial intelligence programs against people to determine if computers can “think.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Named for computer pioneer Alan Turing, the Tur­ing Test convenes a panel of judges who pose questions—ranging anywhere from celebrity gossip to moral conundrums—to hidden contestants in an attempt to discern which is human and which is a computer. The machine that most often fools the panel wins the Most Human Computer Award. But there is also a prize, bizarre and intriguing, for the Most Human Human. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In 2008, the top AI program came short of passing the Turing Test by just one astonishing vote. In 2009, Brian Christian was chosen to participate, and he set out to make sure &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens &lt;/i&gt;would prevail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The author’s quest to be deemed more human than a com­puter opens a window onto our own nature. Interweaving modern phenomena like customer service “chatbots” and men using programmed dialogue to pick up women in bars with insights from fields as diverse as chess, psychiatry, and the law, Brian Christian examines the philosophical, bio­logical, and moral issues raised by the Turing Test. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One central definition of &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; has been “a being that could reason.” If computers can reason, what does that mean for the special place we reserve for humanity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRAISE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A fascinating exploration of what it means to be human. This book will surely change the way readers think about their conversations."--Booklist, starred review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A heady exploration of the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and human nature. Christian's examination of the way machines are forcing us to appreciate what it means to be human leads him to explore everything from poetry, chess and existentialism…[and] offers an overview of the history of AI." -- Kirkus Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is a strange, fertile, and sometimes beautiful book. It has been said that man creates images of himself, then comes to resemble the images. Something like this seems to be going on with the computer. Brian Christian writes with a rare combination of what Pascal took to be two contrary mindsets: the spirit of geometry and the spirit of finesse. He takes both the deep limitations and halting progress of artificial intelligence as an occasion for thinking about the most human activity—the art of conversation." --Matthew B. Crawford, author of Shop Class as Soulcraft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is such an important book, a book I've been waiting and hoping for. Machines are getting so smart that it forces us to take a completely fresh look at what smart is, and at what human is. Brian Christian takes on this very weighty task, and somehow makes it fun. Christian is nimble, insightful, and humble -- a very human human, indeed, and one you will like very much."&lt;br /&gt;- David Shenk, author of The Forgetting, The Immortal Game, and The Genius in All of Us &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"THE MOST HUMAN HUMAN is immensely ambitious and bold, intellectually provocative, while at the same time entertaining and witty – a delightful book about how to live a meaningful, thriving life." --Alan Lightman, author of Einstein’s Dreams and Ghost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A book exploring the wild frontiers of chat-bots is appealing enough; I never expected to discover in its pages such an eye-opening inquest into human imagination, thought, conversation, love and deception. Who would have guessed that the best way to understand humanity was to study its imitators?" --David Eagleman, author of Sum and Why The Net Matters</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut from &lt;i&gt;Forbes'&lt;/i&gt; third most powerful woman in the world, Melinda Gates, a timely and necessary call to action for women's empowerment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last twenty years, Melinda Gates has been on a mission. Her goal, as co-chair of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has been to find solutions for people with the most urgent needs, wherever they live. Throughout this journey, one thing has become increasingly clear to her: If you want to lift a society up, invest in women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid and inspiring book, Gates traces her awakening to the link between women's empowerment and the health of societies. She shows some of the tremendous opportunities that exist right now to “turbo-charge" change. And she provides simple and effective ways each one of us can make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that all women should be free to decide whether and when to have children, Gates took her first step onto the global stage to make a stand for family planning. That step launched her into further efforts: to ensure women everywhere have access to every kind of job; to encourage men around the globe to share equally in the burdens of household work; to advocate for paid family leave for everyone; to eliminate gender bias in all its forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout, Gates introduces us to her heroes in the movement towards equality, offers startling data, shares moving conversations she's had with women from all over the world—and shows how we can all get involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A personal statement of passionate conviction, this book tells of Gates' journey from a partner working behind the scenes to one of the world's foremost advocates for women, driven by the belief that no one should be excluded, all lives have equal value, and gender equity is the lever that lifts everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the PEN/Malamud for Short Stories&lt;br /&gt; A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Notable Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In these “vivid, entertaining, philosophical dispatches” (&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;), literary legend Le Guin weaves together influences as wide-reaching as Borges, &lt;i&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Gulliver’s Travels &lt;/i&gt;to examine feminism, tyranny, mortality and immortality, art, and the meaning—and mystery—of being human.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sita Dulip has missed her flight out of Chicago. But instead of listening to garbled announcements in the airport, she’s found a method of bypassing the crowds at the desks, the nasty lunch, the whimpering children and punitive parents, and the blue plastic chairs bolted to the floor: she changes planes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Changing planes—not airplanes, of course, but entire planes of existence—enables Sita to visit societies not found on Earth. As “Sita Dulip’s Method” spreads, the narrator and her acquaintances encounter cultures where the babble of children fades over time into the silence of adults; where whole towns exist solely for holiday shopping; where personalities are ruled by rage; where genetic experiments produce less than desirable results. With “the eye of an anthropologist and the humor of a satirist” (&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;), Le Guin takes readers on a truly universal tour, showing through the foreign and alien indelible truths about our own human society.</description>

  <description>Will Durant once wrote that "most history is guessing, &amp;amp; the rest is prejudice." Now, 33 years later, the Durants, in this peroration to their monumental "Story of Civilization," look back to record the lessons &amp;amp; conclusions of their 10-volume excursion into human folly &amp;amp; achievement--&amp;amp;, coincidentally, to determine what value historical guesswork &amp;amp; historians' predispositions may have in understanding the nature of humanity. Their reflections are thematic in nature, discussing the influence &amp;amp; effect upon history of certain qualities, institutions &amp;amp; race, character, moral systems, religion, socialism, government, war etc. Their overall conclusion is at once optimistic &amp;amp; realistic; the phenomenon of progress is no figment of the historian's imagination; it's real, in the sense that each generation is born to a heritage richer than that received by their fathers. Thus, the 20th century is the most blessed of all eras so far, from a cultural standpoint, for it has assimilated the best of the Periclean Greeks, of the Renaissance, of the Voltairian age etc. The Durants' "Story" is, despite the cavils of a few disputatious historians, the historical synthesis par excellence for the intelligent nonspecialist. The Lessons of History, despite its extreme brevity, forms an integrally necessary part of that opus &amp;amp; must be read as such, or as an independent work in the tradition of Augustine's Retractationes &amp;amp; Toynbee's Reconsiderations.--Kirkus (edited)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A grand vision defined: The CEO of The Walt Disney Company shares the ideas and values he has used to reinvent one of the most beloved companies in the world, and inspire the people who bring the magic to life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2005, Robert Iger became CEO of The Walt Disney Company during a difficult time. Morale had deteriorated, competition was more intense, and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company's history. "I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past," Iger writes. "The only thing that mattered was the future, and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go." It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve years later, Disney is the largest, most respected media company in the world counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he's sharing the lessons he's learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It's also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolving &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; myth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Over the past fourteen years, I think I've learned so much about what real leadership is," Iger writes. "But I couldn't have articulated all of this until I lived it. You can't fake it--and that's one of the key lessons in this book."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Librarian Note:&lt;/b&gt; This is an Advance Reader Copy issued with ISBN 9780399592096.

      <![CDATA[Better than I expected. Opens with an unexpectedly emotional story, and stays engaging throughout. As I accumulate more work experience, I think this kind of book becomes more interesting to me because I can relate to more of the episodes, but this is a well-done instance of the genre for anyone who's interested. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; How the world's leading innovators push their ideas to fruition again and again &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Edison famously said that genius is 1 percent inspiration, 99 percent perspiration. Ideas for new businesses, solutions to the world's problems, and artistic breakthroughs are common, but great execution is rare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; According to Scott Belsky, the capacity to make ideas happen can be developed by anyone willing to develop their organizational habits and leadership capability. That's why he founded Behance, a company that helps creative people and teams across industries develop these skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Belsky has spent six years studying the habits of creative people and teams that are especially productive-the ones who make their ideas happen time and time again. After interviewing hundreds of successful creatives, he has compiled their most powerful-and often counterintuitive-practices, such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; •Generate ideas in moderation and kill ideas liberally &lt;br /&gt; •Prioritize through nagging &lt;br /&gt; •Encourage fighting within your team &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While many of us obsess about discovering great new ideas, Belsky shows why it's better to develop the capacity to make ideas happen-a capacity that endures over time.</description>

  <description>The primacy of words over images has deep roots in Western culture. But what if the two are inextricably linked, equal partners in meaning-making? Written and drawn entirely as comics, &lt;i&gt;Unflattening&lt;/i&gt; is an experiment in visual thinking. Nick Sousanis defies conventional forms of scholarly discourse to offer readers both a stunning work of graphic art and a serious inquiry into the ways humans construct knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unflattening&lt;/i&gt; is an insurrection against the fixed viewpoint. Weaving together diverse ways of seeing drawn from science, philosophy, art, literature, and mythology, it uses the collage-like capacity of comics to show that perception is always an active process of incorporating and reevaluating different vantage points. While its vibrant, constantly morphing images occasionally serve as illustrations of text, they more often connect in nonlinear fashion to other visual references throughout the book. They become allusions, allegories, and motifs, pitting realism against abstraction and making us aware that more meets the eye than is presented on the page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its graphic innovations and restless shape-shifting, &lt;i&gt;Unflattening&lt;/i&gt; is meant to counteract the type of narrow, rigid thinking that Sousanis calls “flatness.” Just as the two-dimensional inhabitants of Edwin A. Abbott’s novella &lt;i&gt;Flatland&lt;/i&gt; could not fathom the concept of “upwards,” Sousanis says, we are often unable to see past the boundaries of our current frame of mind. Fusing words and images to produce new forms of knowledge, &lt;i&gt;Unflattening&lt;/i&gt; teaches us how to access modes of understanding beyond what we normally apprehend.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A beautifully designed guidebook to the unnoticed yet essential elements of our cities, from the creators of the wildly popular &lt;i&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/i&gt; podcast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you ever wondered what those bright, squiggly graffiti marks on the sidewalk mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or stopped to consider why you don't see metal fire escapes on new buildings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or pondered the story behind those dancing inflatable figures in car dealerships?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/i&gt; is a big-ideas podcast about small-seeming things, revealing stories baked into the buildings we inhabit, the streets we drive, and the sidewalks we traverse. The show celebrates design and architecture in all of its functional glory and accidental absurdity, with intriguing tales of both designers and the people impacted by their designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;The 99% Invisible City: A Field Guide to Hidden World of Everyday Design&lt;/i&gt;, host Roman Mars and coauthor Kurt Kohlstedt zoom in on the various elements that make our cities work, exploring the origins and other fascinating stories behind everything from power grids and fire escapes to drinking fountains and street signs. With deeply researched entries and beautiful line drawings throughout, &lt;i&gt;The 99% Invisible City &lt;/i&gt;will captivate devoted fans of the show and anyone curious about design, urban environments, and the unsung marvels of the world around them.</description>

  <description>A jaw-dropping exploration of everything that goes wrong when we build AI systems and the movement to fix them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today’s "machine-learning" systems, trained by data, are so effective that we’ve invited them to see and hear for us—and to make decisions on our behalf. But alarm bells are ringing. Recent years have seen an eruption of concern as the field of machine learning advances. When the systems we attempt to teach will not, in the end, do what we want or what we expect, ethical and potentially existential risks emerge. Researchers call this the alignment problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Systems cull résumés until, years later, we discover that they have inherent gender biases. Algorithms decide bail and parole—and appear to assess Black and white defendants differently. We can no longer assume that our mortgage application, or even our medical tests, will be seen by human eyes. And as autonomous vehicles share our streets, we are increasingly putting our lives in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mathematical and computational models driving these changes range in complexity from something that can fit on a spreadsheet to a complex system that might credibly be called “artificial intelligence.” They are steadily replacing both human judgment and explicitly programmed software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In best-selling author Brian Christian’s riveting account, we meet the alignment problem’s “first-responders,” and learn their ambitious plan to solve it before our hands are completely off the wheel. In a masterful blend of history and on-the ground reporting, Christian traces the explosive growth in the field of machine learning and surveys its current, sprawling frontier. Readers encounter a discipline finding its legs amid exhilarating and sometimes terrifying progress. Whether they—and we—succeed or fail in solving the alignment problem will be a defining human story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alignment Problem&lt;/em&gt; offers an unflinching reckoning with humanity’s biases and blind spots, our own unstated assumptions and often contradictory goals. A dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, it takes a hard look not only at our technology but at our culture—and finds a story by turns harrowing and hopeful.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Harvard University’s Joseph Henrich, Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, delivers a bold, epic investigation into the development of the Western mind, global psychological diversity, and its impact on the world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Perhaps you are raised in a society that is Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. If so, you’re rather psychologically peculiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike much of the world today, and most people who have ever lived, WEIRD people are highly individualistic, self-obsessed, control-oriented, nonconformist, and analytical. They focus on themselves—their attributes, accomplishments, and aspirations—over their relationships and social roles. How did WEIRD populations become so psychologically distinct? What role did these psychological differences play in the industrial revolution and the global expansion of Europe during the last few centuries? Did these differences have an impact on the development of the laws, economic systems, and governments that now dominate the world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;W.E.I.R.D. Minds&lt;/i&gt;, Joseph Henrich draws on cutting-edge research in anthropology, psychology, economics, and evolutionary biology to explore these questions and more. He illuminates the origins and evolution of family structures, marriage, and religion, and the profound impact these cultural transformations had on human psychology. Mapping these shifts through ancient history and late antiquity, Henrich reveals that the most fundamental institutions of kinship and marriage changed dramatically under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church. It was these changes that gave rise to the WEIRD psychology that would coevolve with impersonal markets, occupational specialization, and free competition—laying the foundation for the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provocative and engaging in both its broad scope and its surprising details, &lt;i&gt;W.E.I.R.D. Minds&lt;/i&gt; explores how culture, institutions, and psychology shape one another, and explains what this means for both our most personal sense of who we are as individuals and also the large-scale social, political, and economic forces that drive human history.</description>

  <description>What is the difference between a wink and a blink? The answer is important not only to philosophers of mind, for significant moral and legal consequences rest on the distinction between voluntary and involuntary behavior. However, "action theory" -- the branch of philosophy that has traditionally articulated the boundaries between action and non-action, and between voluntary and involuntary behavior -- has been unable to account for the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia Juarrero argues that a mistaken, 350-year-old model of cause and explanation -- one that takes all causes to be of the push-pull, efficient cause sort, and all explanation to be prooflike -- underlies contemporary theories of action. Juarrero then proposes a new framework for conceptualizing causes based on complex adaptive systems. Thinking of causes as dynamical constraints makes bottom-up and top-down causal relations, including those involving intentional causes, suddenly tractable. A different logic for explaining actions -- as historical narrative, not inference -- follows if one adopts this novel approach to long-standing questions of action and responsibility.</description>

Or has something more interesting and important happened? Will we ever get flying cars? This book offers a compelling analysis of the past and a surprising view of the future.</description>

  <description>In 1997, a runaway teenager and her yellow toy robot travel west through a strange USA. The ruins of gigantic battle drones litter the countryside, heaped together with the discarded trash of a high tech consumerist society in decline. As their car approaches the edge of the continent, the world outside the window seems to be unraveling ever faster—as if somewhere beyond the horizon, the hollow core of civilization has finally caved in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon Stålenhag is the internationally acclaimed author, concept designer, and artist behind Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood. His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes have made Stålenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world. In The Electric State, Stålenhag turns his unique vision to America.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;TOO LOUD A SOLITUDE is a tender and funny story of Haňťa - a man who has lived in a Czech police state - for 35 years, working as compactor of wastepaper and books. In the process of compacting, he has acquired an education so unwitting he can't quite tell which of his thoughts are his own and which come from his books. He has rescued many from jaws of hydraulic press and now his house is filled to the rooftops. Destroyer of the written word, he is also its perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a new automatic press makes his job redundant there's only one thing he can do - go down with his ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an eccentric romp celebrating the indestructability- against censorship, political opression etc - of the written word.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Pulitzer Prize–winning, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Warmth of Other Suns&lt;/i&gt; examines the unspoken caste system that has shaped America and shows how our lives today are still defined by a hierarchy of human divisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theater, flashlight cast down in the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power—which groups have it and which do not.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people—including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others—she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Incognito&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; and&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt; Sum&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; comes a revelatory portrait of the human brain based on the most recent scientific discoveries about how it unceasingly adapts, re-creates, and formulates new ways of understanding the world we live in.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic of the brain is not found in the parts it's made of but in the way those parts unceasingly reweave themselves in an electric living fabric. And there is no more accomplished and accessible guide than renowned neuroscientist David Eagleman to help us understand the nature and changing texture of that fabric. With his hallmark clarity and enthusiasm he reveals the myriad ways that the brain absorbs experience: developing, redeploying, organizing, and arranging the data it receives from the body's own absorption of external stimuli, which enables us to gain the skills, the facilities, and the practices that make us who we are.&lt;br /&gt; Eagleman covers decades of the most important research into the functioning of the brain and presents new discoveries from his own research as well: about the nature of synesthesia, about dreaming, and about wearable devices that are revolutionizing how we think about the five human senses. Finally, &lt;i&gt;Livewired&lt;/i&gt; is as deeply informative as it is accessible and brilliantly engaging.</description>

  <description>What would you do if a time machine hurled you thousands of years into the past. . . and then broke? How would you survive? Could you improve on humanity's original timeline? And how hard would it be to domesticate a giant wombat? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this book as your guide, you'll survive--and thrive--in any period in Earth's history. Bestselling author and time-travel enthusiast Ryan North shows you how to invent all the modern conveniences we take for granted--from first principles. This illustrated manual contains all the science, engineering, art, philosophy, facts, and figures required for even the most clueless time traveler to build a civilization from the ground up. Deeply researched, irreverent, and significantly more fun than being eaten by a saber-toothed tiger, How to Invent Everything will make you smarter, more competent, and completely prepared to become the most important and influential person ever.</description>

  <description>These essays trace a distinguished writer's engagement with her time, her arguments with herself and others. "I am a poet who knows the social power of poetry, a United States citizen who knows herself irrevocably tangled in her society's hopes, arrogance, and despair," Adrienne Rich writes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The essays in Arts of the Possible search for possibilities beyond a compromised, degraded system, seeking to imagine something else. They call on the fluidity of the imagination, from poetic vision to social justice, from the badlands of political demoralization to an art that might wound, that may open scars when engaged in its work, but will finally suture and not tear apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This volume collects Rich's essays from the last decade of the twentieth century, including four earlier essays, as well as several conversations that go further than the usual interview. Also included is her essay explaining her reasons for declining the National Medal for the Arts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An against-the-grain polemic on American capitalism from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tyler Cowen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;We love to hate the 800-pound gorilla. Walmart and Amazon destroy communities and small businesses. Facebook turns us into addicts while putting our personal data at risk. From skeptical politicians like Bernie Sanders who, at a 2016 presidential campaign rally said, "If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist," to millennials, only 42 percent of whom support capitalism, belief in big business is at an all-time low. But are big companies inherently evil? If business is so bad, why does it remain so integral to the basic functioning of America? Economist and bestselling author Tyler Cowen says our biggest problem is that we don't love business enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Big Business&lt;/i&gt;, Cowen puts forth an impassioned defense of corporations and their essential role in a balanced, productive, and progressive society. He dismantles common misconceptions and untangles conflicting intuitions. According to a 2016 Gallup survey, only 12 percent of Americans trust big business "quite a lot," and only 6 percent trust it "a great deal." Yet Americans as a group are remarkably willing to trust businesses, whether in the form of buying a new phone on the day of its release or simply showing up to work in the expectation they will be paid. Cowen illuminates the crucial role businesses play in spurring innovation, rewarding talent and hard work, and creating the bounty on which we've all come to depend.</description>

      <![CDATA[Tyler Cowen is fantastic but this isn’t his best. Read Average is Over instead. This book makes solid arguments but I bet the people that’ll read this book already agree.<br /><br />The focus is on specific critiques/complaints, but I think it would have been more effective to directly address the underlying assumption/belief that we could somehow keep the same level of wealth and invention but replace the entities that produce it. He alludes to other countries and eras without good governance or active free economies but doesn’t hammer the point - the incredible prosperity we enjoy is an amazing, precarious result of countless people and systems interacting in a historically unique way, and all other approaches haven’t come close.]]>

  <description>There is a lifeform so strange and wondrous that it forces us to rethink how life works…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither plant nor animal, it is found throughout the earth, the air and our bodies. It can be microscopic, yet also accounts for the largest organisms ever recorded, living for millennia and weighing tens of thousands of tonnes. Its ability to digest rock enabled the first life on land, it can survive unprotected in space, and thrives amidst nuclear radiation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this captivating adventure, Merlin Sheldrake explores the spectacular and neglected world of fungi: endlessly surprising organisms that sustain nearly all living systems. They can solve problems without a brain, stretching traditional definitions of ‘intelligence’, and can manipulate animal behaviour with devastating precision. In giving us bread, alcohol and life-saving medicines, fungi have shaped human history, and their psychedelic properties, which have influenced societies since antiquity, have recently been shown to alleviate a number of mental illnesses. The ability of fungi to digest plastic, explosives, pesticides and crude oil is being harnessed in break-through technologies, and the discovery that they connect plants in underground networks, the ‘Wood Wide Web’, is transforming the way we understand ecosystems. Yet they live their lives largely out of sight, and over ninety percent of their species remain undocumented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Entangled Life&lt;/i&gt; is a mind-altering journey into this hidden kingdom of life, and shows that fungi are key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel and behave. The more we learn about fungi, the less makes sense without them.</description>

  <description>Ibram X. Kendi's concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice in America--but even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. In &lt;i&gt;How to be an Antiracist&lt;/i&gt;, Kendi asks us to think about what an antiracist society might look like, and how we can play an active role in building it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Kendi weaves together an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science, bringing it all together with an engaging personal narrative of his own awakening to antiracism. &lt;i&gt;How to Be an Antiracist&lt;/i&gt; is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond an awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a truly just and equitable society.</description>

      <![CDATA[More of a reflective autobiography than a how-to guide (but what would a how-to guide even be in this context?). The analogies and arguments are clearly presented by the chapter structure and the many uses of parallel construction in the text itself. Some statements are easily attacked out of context (inequity between any groups defined on any dimension is racism, genetics don't influence behavior, racist policy is purely the result of racist people and not systems) but the overall pragmatic thesis rings true to me - antiracism is whatever actually reduces racial inequity, and racism is whatever increases racial inequity.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A short and entertaining book on the modern art of writing well by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Steven Pinker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is so much writing so bad, and how can we make it better? Is the English language being corrupted by texting and social media? Do the kids today even care about good writing? Why should any of us care?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Sense of Style&lt;/i&gt;, the bestselling linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker answers these questions and more. Rethinking the usage guide for the twenty-first century, Pinker doesn’t carp about the decline of language or recycle pet peeves from the rulebooks of a century ago. Instead, he applies insights from the sciences of language and mind to the challenge of crafting clear, coherent, and stylish prose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this short, cheerful, and eminently practical book, Pinker shows how writing depends on imagination, empathy, coherence, grammatical knowhow, and an ability to savor and reverse engineer the good prose of others. He replaces dogma about usage with reason and evidence, allowing writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, rather than robotically, being mindful of what they are designed to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Filled with examples of great and gruesome prose, Pinker shows us how the art of writing can be a form of pleasurable mastery and a fascinating intellectual topic in its own right.</description>

  <description>Piranesi’s house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one other person in the house—a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The long-awaited new novel from Greg Egan! Hugo Award-winning author Egan returns to the field with &lt;i&gt;Incandescence&lt;/i&gt;, a new novel of hard SF.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amalgam spans nearly the entire galaxy, and is composed of innumerable beings from a wild variety of races, some human or near it, some entirely other. The one place that they cannot go is the bulge, the bright, hot center of the galaxy. There dwell the Aloof, who for millions of years have deflected any and all attempts to communicate with or visit them. So when Rakesh is offered an opportunity to travel within their sphere, in search of a lost race, he cannot turn it down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roi is a member of that lost race, which is not only lost to the Amalgam, but lost to itself. In their world, there is but toil, and history and science are luxuries that they can ill afford. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rakesh's journey will take him across millennia and light years. Roi's will take her across vistas of learning and discovery just as vast.</description>

  <description>Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Peer under the hood of the systems you already use, and learn how to use and operate them more effectively&lt;br /&gt; Make informed decisions by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different tools&lt;br /&gt; Navigate the trade-offs around consistency, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity&lt;br /&gt; Understand the distributed systems research upon which modern databases are built&lt;br /&gt; Peek behind the scenes of major online services, and learn from their architectures</description>

  <description>David Roberts, "veteran mountain climber and chronicler of adventures" (&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;), has spent his career documenting voyages to the most extreme landscapes on earth. In &lt;em&gt;Limits of the Known&lt;/em&gt;, he reflects on humanity’s—and his own—relationship to extreme risk. Part memoir and part history, this book tries to make sense of why so many have committed their lives to the desperate pursuit of adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of his diagnosis with throat cancer, Roberts seeks answers with sharp new urgency. He explores his own lifelong commitment to adventuring, as well as the cultural contributions of explorers throughout history: What specific forms of courage and commitment did it take for Fridtjof Nansen to survive an eighteen-month journey from a record "farthest north" with no supplies and a single rifle during his polar expedition of 1893–96? What compelled Eric Shipton to return, five times, to the ridges of Mt. Everest, plotting the mountain’s most treacherous territory years before Hillary and Tenzing’s famous ascent? What drove Bill Stone to dive 3,000 feet underground into North America’s deepest cave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What motivates the explorers we most admire, who are willing to embark on perilous journeys and push the limits of the human body? And what is the future of adventure in a world we have mapped and trodden from end to end?</description>
