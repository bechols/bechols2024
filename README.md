## Key Features

### TanStack Server Functions
The books page uses TanStack Server Functions for secure server-side API calls to Goodreads, providing:
- Server-side data fetching
- Automatic loading states
- Type-safe data handling

### File-Based Routing
Routes are automatically generated from the file structure in `src/app/`:
- `/` → `index.tsx`
- `/about` → `about.tsx` 
- `/about/user-manual` → `about/user-manual.tsx`
- `/books` → `books.tsx`
- `/interesting` → `interesting.tsx`

### Component System
Built on top of shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components:
- Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Full TypeScript support
- Customizable design tokens

## Environment Variables

|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GOODREADS_USER_ID` | Your Goodreads user ID for API calls | Yes (for books page) |
| `GOODREADS_API_KEY` | Your Goodreads API key | Yes (for books page) |
